40948474,Piezodynamic Therapy: Unleashing Mechanical Energy and Featuristic Next Generation Therapeutic Paradigms for Glioblastoma.,"Glioblastoma (GBM), the most lethal primary brain tumor in adults, is characterized by extensive infiltration, marked heterogeneity, and resistance to conventional therapies. The blood-brain barrier (BBB) impedes effective drug delivery; therefore, recent advancements in energy-based therapies have introduced innovative approaches to overcome these challenges. These include focused ultrasound, tumor-treating fields, magnetomechanical actuation, and triboelectric stimulation to transiently disrupt the BBB and facilitate targeted treatment. Piezodynamic therapy has emerged as a key strategy, using piezoelectric nanomaterials to convert mechanical stimuli into reactive oxygen species (ROS) and immunogenic signals, inducing localized oxidative stress and immune activation. This approach is complemented by nanogas-based technologies, which enhance spatiotemporal control over ROS generation through ultrasound-driven piezocatalysis. Novel 3D-bioprinted GBM models provide patient-specific platforms for optimizing these therapies and investigating piezodynamic effects in realistic tumor environments. Concurrently, implantable smart devices enable real-time modulation of mechanical stimuli, improving treatment precision. Tumor vaccines also play a complementary role by amplifying systemic anti-GBM immune responses. Challenges such as nanoparticle biocompatibility, precise regulation of physical stimuli, and clinical translation persist. This review evaluates the existing energy-based multimodal treatments and integration of piezodynamic therapy with nanogas technologies, 3D bioprinting, and immune-stimulating vaccines, highlighting their potential as a featuristic strategy to overcome GBM's therapeutic resistance.",ACS nano,2025,downloaded,10.1021/acsnano.5c11629
40905947,Ultrasound-Mediated Piezocatalysis Triggers NO Release to Augment Targeted Immunotherapy of Pancreatic Cancer.,"Although immune checkpoint inhibitor-based immunotherapy has shown clinical efficacy in various cancer types, its efficacy in pancreatic cancer remains limited. This limitation is primarily attributed to the dense stromal tumor microenvironment (TME) and highly immunosuppressive TME of pancreatic cancer. The dense stromal TME forms a physical barrier that severely hinders the penetration and accumulation of therapeutic agents and immune cells. Additionally, it collaborates with the immunosuppressive TME to weaken immune responses against tumors. To overcome these challenges, a piezoelectric nanoparticle system, BTO@BAL, was developed, which combined piezoelectric nanomaterial barium titanate (BTO), a targeting peptide, and an amphiphilic prodrug molecule. The prodrug molecule is composed of a small-molecule PD-L1 inhibitor (BMS1166) and a nitric oxide (NO) donor (Arg)9, linked by a thioketal bond. Upon ultrasound (US)-triggered piezocatalysis, BTO continuously generated reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the hypoxic TME. On the one hand, ROS oxidized (Arg)9 to release NO, which degraded the dense stromal barrier of pancreatic cancer, remodeled the TME, improved tumor mechanical properties, and reduced stiffness. Combined with the targeted peptide, this strategy synergistically improved drug delivery efficiency. Furthermore, the combined action of ROS and NO enhanced the immunogenicity of pancreatic cancer, promoting the activation and maturation of local dendritic cells, thereby strengthening antitumor immune responses. On the other hand, ROS induced thioketal bond cleavage to release BMS1166, effectively down-regulating PD-L1 expression on KPC cells, reshaping the immunosuppressive TME of pancreatic cancer, and further amplifying the efficacy of immunotherapy. This strategy integrated US-triggered piezocatalysis with gas therapy, greatly enhancing pancreatic cancer immunotherapy and offering a theoretical foundation for developing tumor theranostic platforms.",ACS nano,2025,downloaded,10.1021/acsnano.5c10301.s001
40856492,Orally Deliverable Engineered Porphyrin Nanohybrids Activate the cGAS-STING Axis and Enable Fusobacterium-Specific Targeting for Robust Immune Remodeling and Colorectal Cancer Regression.,"The susceptibility of colorectal cancer (CRC) cells to Fusobacterium nucleatum (F. nucleatum) infection pose significant challenges to CRC treatment and prevention. This study addresses these challenges by mobilizing cGAS/STING axis activation and F. nucleatum-specific targeting, thereby achieving a multimodal treatment strategy for reversing the immunosuppressive microenvironment (ITM) and achieving targeted anti-F. nucleatum therapy. Specifically, a hybrid nanoplatform CuPpIX@HM was engineered using Escherichia coli and tumor cell membranes encapsulating ultrasound (US) stimulation-responsive copper protoporphyrin IX (CuPpIX). This design enables the precise accumulation of the nanoplatform at tumor sites following oral administration. Notably, upon US activation, CuPpIX generates a high level of reactive oxygen species (ROS), selectively eradicating F. nucleatum and exerting potent antitumor effects. Meanwhile, bacterial membrane components activate the cGAS/STING signaling pathway, effectively reversing the ITM, enhancing systemic antitumor immunity. Importantly, CuPpIX@HM exerts minimal disruption to healthy intestinal microbiota and remarkably increases the level of probiotics. In both orthotopic and liver metastasis, CRC models demonstrated that this strategy could significantly inhibit tumor growth and metastasis. Collectively, our study presents a highly targeted multimodal nanotherapy that holds strong potential to improve CRC treatment outcomes through the precision modulation of F. nucleatum and immune activation.",ACS applied materials & interfaces,2025,downloaded,10.1021/acsami.5c09122.s001
40815269,Catalase enzyme-modified carbon quantum dot nanoparticles with hypoxia alleviation associated with indocyanine green for synchronous augmented photodynamic therapy and cell imaging of melanoma.,"The aim of this study was to synthesize carbon quantum dot nanoparticles (CQD NPs) with a high quantum yield and conjugate them with the enzyme catalase (CAT) for cell imaging and photodynamic therapy (PDT) applications. CQDs were synthesized by a hydrothermal method and purified with a novel method to obtain a high quantum yield. Indocyanine green (ICG) was loaded on the CQDs as a suitable photosensitizer for PDT, and CAT was applied to generate oxygen at the tumor site. Then, the efficacy of the synthesized NPs for photodynamic therapy (PDT) and cell imaging of melanoma cancer cells was investigated under in vitro, ex vivo and in vivo conditions. Characterization results confirmed that the hydrodynamic size of the CAT-ICG@CQD particles was about 51.3 nm. In addition, analysis to detect reactive oxygen species (ROS) demonstrated that free ICG's ROS generation capacity increased significantly (26%) after combining with CAT. Moreover, cell culture assessments revealed that CAT-ICG@CQD could decrease melanoma cell viability by up to 15.66%, with laser illumination in a simulated tumor microenvironment resulting in higher cellular uptake, sustained release and a higher ROS generation capacity in comparison to free ICG. Cell imaging analysis illustrated high fluorescence intensity of ICG in the cytoplasm for CAT-ICG@CQD, confirming its high quantum yield and enhanced cellular uptake of ICG compared to free ICG. An in vivo study on C57BL/6 mice with melanomas revealed that CAT-ICG@CQD exhibits superior tumor growth inhibition through tumor oxygenation, indicating efficient PDT enabled by hypoxia alleviation. The outcome of the present study provided a novel nanoplatform for ameliorating tumor hypoxia, which meets the demands of melanoma PDT due to the high ROS generation efficiency and cell imaging capabilities.",Nanoscale,2025,downloaded,10.1039/d5nr02133b
40761027,Ce6-DNAzyme-Loaded Metal-Organic Framework Theranostic Agents for Boosting miRNA Imaging-Guided Photodynamic Therapy in Breast Cancer.,"Breast cancer remains a leading cause of mortality among women globally, underscoring the critical need for effective theranostic strategies. MicroRNA-21 (miR-21) imaging-guided photodynamic therapy (PDT) has attracted significant attention in recent years due to its selectivity and sensitivity toward breast cancer. However, key challenges remain, particularly regarding the low abundance of miR-21 caused by low-quality imaging at the tumor site and the low efficiency of PDT. To address these issues, we developed theranostic Ce6-DNAzyme@ZIF-8@PEG nanoparticles (CDZP NPs) for breast cancer, which integrates dual-cycling signal amplification for miR-21 detection and enhanced PDT through GPX4-DNAzyme-mediated gene editing to inhibit reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavenging. The CDZP NPs are based on a dodecahedral metal-organic framework (MOF) ZIF-8, encapsulating a dual-cycling miR-21 imaging system and Ce6-DNAzyme therapeutic system via one-pot synthesis. CDZP NPs exhibit excellent biocompatibility, acid-responsive release behavior, and a high loading capacity. These properties enable the control release of Zn2+, Ce6, and dual-cycling signal magnification system for miR-21 detection and enhanced PDT. In vivo studies with tumor-bearing mice demonstrated that intravenous injection of CDZP NPs could effectively target tumors. The dual-cycling signal amplification system, comprising three hairpin probes (H1, H2, and H3), achieved a detection limit for miR-21 as low as 3.4 pM. Moreover, Zn2+-activated GPX4-DNAzyme significantly inhibited GPX4 protein expression, reducing ROS scavenging and further enhancing PDT efficiency with a high tumor inhibition rate of 72.3%. This proposed theranostic strategy holds promise for advancing precision theranostics in breast cancer treatment.",ACS nano,2025,downloaded,10.1021/acsnano.5c09287
40755136,Phage-augmented casein nanocarriers for targeted bioimaging and enhanced combinatorial therapy of triple-negative breast cancer.,"Cancer is a complex disease, and its development depends on multiple factors, so even after treatment with conventional modalities controlling (inhibiting or accelerating) one of the few factors would not be efficient in cancer mitigation, and the side effects with it are inevitable. One of the major side effects is damaged immune systems, rendering patients with increased chances of microbial infections. Candidiasis is the most common infection seen in surface cancers such as breast cancer. Clotrimazole (Cm) is a well-known antifungal drug, and recently it has been reported to exhibit anticancer activity against breast cancer. As combinatorial therapy has been proven to be highly effective in treating diseases, clotrimazole along with IR780 was encapsulated into phage (Φ)-modified casein nanocarriers (ΦCIRCm NCs). Then, their antifungal activity against Candida albicans was evaluated using spot assay, calcofluor white, and FDA/PI staining. In comparison to casein NCs (CIRCm NCs) the ΦCIRCm NCs showed significantly higher antifungal activity as the presence of phage significantly increased the encapsulation and photothermal transduction efficiency of IR780. Then, for targeted bioimaging and therapy, these NCs were further modified by GSH conjugation. During the conjugation step the presence of phage significantly prevented the loss of IR780 from the NCs. These NCs were evaluated for their theranostic efficiency using 4T1 cells and various in vitro assays. The GSH conjugated NCs (ΦCIRCm-G NCs) displayed significantly higher theranostic efficiency in 2D and 3D cell cultures compared to the control and treatment groups and induced cellular apoptosis by generating ROS and mitochondrial damage eventually causing cell death. Then, the specific targetability and therapeutic efficiency of NCs in the 4T1 breast cancer model were evaluated. The ΦCIRCm-G NCs were specifically accumulated in tumors when compared to ΦCIRCm NCs. Further the in vivo results of ΦCIRCm NCs also displayed significant antitumor efficiency and without causing any damage to the healthy tissues. The targeted NCs will provide new avenues to enhance the theranostic efficacy of various combinatorial therapeutic approaches for treating cancer and its associated health risks with minimal or no side effects.",Nanoscale,2025,downloaded,10.1039/d5nr01826a
40685755,Targeted Intracellular Copper Reservoir Enhances Liver Cancer Immunotherapy.,"Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is commonly classified as a ""cold tumor"" due to its low immunogenicity and poor response to conventional immunotherapies. Reprogramming the tumor immune microenvironment (TIME) via cuproptosis presents a promising strategy to enhance immunotherapies. Herein, sono-activatable N,N,N',N'-tetrakis(2-pyridinylmethyl)-1,2-ethanediamine (TPEN)-encapsulated cancer-targeted nanoparticles (STCNs) designed to modulate the TIME and potentiate immunotherapy through endogenous cuproptosis are reported, termed ""endogenous cuproptosis immunopromotion"". STCNs are rapidly internalized by HCC via folate-mediated endocytosis, and ultrasound irradiation triggers the release of TPEN. TPEN then chelates Cu2⁺ from superoxide dismutase, initiating a Fenton-like reaction induced by glutathione that produces reactive oxygen species (ROS) and Cu⁺. This cascade induces cuproptosis and immunogenic cell death (ICD), promoting robust cytotoxic T lymphocyte infiltration in HCC. The combination of STCNs with anti-programmed cell death protein 1 (PD1) therapy demonstrates significant anti-tumor efficacy in vivo. Moreover, this strategy exhibits similar effectiveness in other solid tumor models, underscoring its broad therapeutic potential. These findings provide a promising framework for enhancing immunotherapy in cold tumors, paving the way for future cancer treatments.","Small (Weinheim an der Bergstrasse, Germany)",2025,downloaded,10.1002/smll.202502783
40669084,Cascade Energy Transformation in Hybrid Nanosensitizer Enables Ultrasound-Activated Luminescence Imaging and Enhanced Sonodynamic Therapy.,"Optical imaging plays a pivotal role in the diagnosis and management of cancer, yet conventional techniques often suffer from limitations such as tissue autofluorescence, insufficient imaging depth, and signal persistence. Here, we introduce a hybrid nanosensitizer, SPNs(SP1)@CoOOH, that leverages cascade energy transformation (ultrasonic → chemical → photonic energy) to enable ultrasound-activated luminescence imaging concomitant with enhanced sonodynamic therapy (SDT). By integrating semiconducting polymer nanoparticles (SPNs) with cobalt oxide hydroxide (CoOOH), our platform facilitates dual-pathway reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation under acidic and ultrasound costimulation. In this system, the ultrasound enhanced the chemodynamic effect of CoOOH to catalyze water into singlet oxygen, while ultrasound improves electron-hole separation within the SPNs, leading to efficient hydroxyl radical formation. This dual mechanism results in a 3.5-fold increase in ROS production relative to SPNs alone and triggers ROS-thiophene interactions that emit luminescence. Notably, the emitted luminescence correlates linearly with ROS levels and tumor inhibition rates, offering a robust method for a real-time monitoring therapeutic process. Furthermore, our modular design extends to other organic systems, including cyanine and porphyrin-based nanostructures, achieving up to 14.2-fold enhancements in ROS generation and 6.3-fold increases in luminescence intensity. By addressing the dual challenges of inefficient ROS production and real-time monitoring in SDT, our study lays the foundation for next-generation ultrasound-driven theranostics, paving the way for luminescence imaging-guided, personalized cancer therapy.",Journal of the American Chemical Society,2025,downloaded,10.1021/jacs.5c06434.s001
40623064,Fe-Polyphenol Self-Assembled Nanoplatform for Sonodynamic-Ferroptosis-Autophagy Inhibition Synergistic Tumor Therapy.,"Effective tumor treatment still faces tough challenges. Sonodynamic therapy (SDT) has gained recognition as a viable substitute for photodynamic therapy, providing enhanced tissue penetration and reduced skin damage by generating reactive oxygen species (ROS) via ultrasound-triggered sonosensitizers. Nonetheless, the therapeutic efficacy of SDT is often hindered by the intrinsic apoptosis resistance of cancer cells. Additionally, apoptosis-resistant cancer cells often exhibit susceptibility to ferroptosis, making the development of an iron enrichment ferroptosis strategy crucial for the combined apoptosis-ferroptosis antitumor therapy. However, tumor cells often counteract apoptosis and ferroptosis by upregulating autophagy; thus, interrupting the autophagic degradation process is vital for the enhancement of the therapeutic outcome. Accordingly, we designed a metal-organic synergistic nanotherapeutic platform (Fe-Rh@IAA NPs) by incorporating iron, rhein, and indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) to target apoptosis, ferroptosis, and autophagy inhibition. Following systemic administration, Fe-Rh@IAA NPs were preferentially gathered at the tumor location, leveraging the enhanced permeability and retention effect. When exposed to ultrasonic irradiation, Fe-Rh@IAA NPs induced apoptosis via SDT, while the Fe ions induced ferroptosis through ROS production and glutathione depletion. At the tumor microenvironment with high concentrations of H2O2, peroxidase-like activity of the nanoparticles converted IAA into the toxic molecule, 3-methylene-2-oxindole, which led to the suppression of autophagy activity and ultimately tumor cell death. In addition, Fe-Rh@IAA NPs could also provide magnetic resonance imaging capability, facilitating noninvasive real-time monitoring of material accumulation within tumor tissue. In vitro and in vivo studies demonstrated that Fe-Rh@IAA NPs exhibited excellent tumor-killing capabilities and favorable biosafety. This three-channel combined therapeutic strategy thus offers new insights and methodologies for tumor treatment.",ACS applied materials & interfaces,2025,downloaded,10.1021/acsami.5c09829.s001
40582643,Ultrasound-activated nanovesicles for adenosine exhaustion and immune checkpoint blockade in cancer immunotherapy.,"Conventional antitumor therapies induce immunogenic cell death (ICD), releasing large amounts of ATP that are rapidly converted into immunosuppressive adenosine within the tumor microenvironment (TME). This accumulation of adenosine promotes tumor immune evasion by inhibiting effector immune cells and upregulating inhibitory immune checkpoints. To overcome this challenge, we designed ultrasound (US)-activated nanovesicle system ADA/Ce6@tLipo which is composed of T cell membranes displaying multiple immune checkpoint molecules and a liposome encapsulating chlorin e6 (Ce6) and adenosine deaminase (ADA). Upon US exposure, these nanovesicles generate reactive oxygen species (ROS) to induce ICD and initiate an antitumor immune response. Concurrently, ADA converts adenosine, produced from ATP breakdown following ICD, into inosine, reversing adenosine-mediated immunosuppression and enhancing T cell activation. Furthermore, the immune checkpoint molecules displayed on the nanovesicles block immune checkpoint ligands on tumor cells, boosting T cell activity and preventing exhaustion. ADA/Ce6@tLipo reprograms the TME by modulating adenosine metabolism and inhibiting multiple immune checkpoints, thereby amplifying T cell-mediated antitumor immunity. This approach offers a promising strategy to enhance the efficacy of cancer immunotherapy.",Journal of controlled release : official journal of the Controlled Release Society,2025,downloaded,10.1016/j.jconrel.2025.113988
40557583,Metal and Covalent Organic Frameworks Meet OB-GYN: Advancing Applications in Women's Health and Pregnancy Care.,"Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) and Covalent-organic frameworks (COFs) are promising materials for biomedical applications due to their high surface area, tunable porosity, and functional versatility. Functionalized or nanoparticle-containing MOFs and COFs have been largely explored in preclinical studies for drug delivery, photodynamic and photothermal therapies, and ROS generation targeting cancer cells, among others. Additionally, they have shown potential as carriers of imaging agents for precise biomarker identification and tumor detection. However, the application of nanomaterials in medicine, including MOFs and COFs, still does not meet the expectations set more than two decades ago. This is particularly important in the maternal-fetal field, where substantial maternal health risks during pregnancy and childbirth affect many women. Only recently a range of preliminary studies exist, as these risks have traditionally been viewed as inherent to pregnancy, leaving significant gaps in innovative solutions for women's health that nanomaterials have the potential to bridge. This review addresses this critical need, offering a summary of current research in obstetrics and gynecology and maternal-fetal applications of MOFs and COFs, identifying gaps, and aiming to guide future research to expand nanomedicine's impact in these areas.","Small (Weinheim an der Bergstrasse, Germany)",2025,downloaded,10.1002/smll.202504366
40554218,A controllable self-amplifying oxidative stress strategy for boosting noninvasive sonodynamic therapy and synergistic immunotherapy.,"The combined application of sonodynamic therapy (SDT) and immune checkpoint blockade may be hindered by the antioxidant defense mechanisms of tumor cells and the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME). SDT may be enhanced through nanotechnology to improve sonosensitizer delivery and drug release triggered by reactive oxygen species (ROS). However, strategies to amplify ROS cascades and synergize with immune checkpoint blockade remain underexplored. In this study, a pH/ROS dual-responsive nanoplatform (designated as FHPCL NPs) that targets tumor tissues with a ""self-amplifying oxidative stress"" strategy to synergistically enhance the efficacy of SDT and immunotherapy was developed. This nanoplatform established a ""drug release-ROS generation-carrier disintegration"" positive feedback loop in the tumor tissues when combined with ultrasound technology, thereby inducing massive ROS production. In a 4T1 breast cancer model, this strategy achieved an in situ tumor suppression rate exceeding 80 %. Importantly, the integrated platform significantly promotes dendritic cell maturation and cytotoxic T lymphocytes infiltration by inducing immunogenic cell death, thereby activating enhanced immune responses and systemic immunological effects. Furthermore, we demonstrated that combining FHPCL NPs-augmented SDT with anti-programmed death ligand 1 markedly inhibited tumor growth and pulmonary metastasis, and established durable immune memory.

40545201,Homotypic biomimetic nanotheranostics enhance locoregional Cherenkov radiation-induced photodynamic therapy and ferroptosis in early bone metastases.,"Theranostics for deep-seated and multifocal bone metastases using conventional nanoparticulate strategies face significant challenges due to limited targeting and insufficient spatial controllability within the lesions. Here, we developed a sophisticated nanocarrier (MC@MH) camouflaged with the homologous prostate cancer cell membrane and ferritin-homing peptide (HKN22). Following systemic injection, the biomimetic nanotheranostics preferentially accumulated in bone metastases through a homotypic targeting mechanism. The acidic/H2O2-rich microenvironment triggered the degradation of MnO2 in MC@MH, leading to the release of Mn2+ ions that enhance magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for bone metastases, particularly at early stages. The HKN22 further promoted interactions between MC@MH and intracellular ferritin. Guided by MRI, the separately administrated radionuclide (68Ga-PSMA-617) also actively navigated to metastatic tumors. Based on the Cherenkov radiation effect, it served as a light source in the lesions, precisely irradiating the photosensitizer (Chlorin e6) released from MC@MH. The cytotoxic ROS generated from Cherenkov radiation-induced PDT not only destroyed cancer cells but also destructed ferritin to initiate a cascade of ferroptosis. Overall, our strategy facilitated bone remodeling and repair while preserving bone homeostasis, offering a novel avenue for locoregional and precise theranostics against metastatic cancer in vivo.",Journal of controlled release : official journal of the Controlled Release Society,2025,downloaded,10.1016/j.jconrel.2025.113971
40525768,Programmatically Controllable Activation of Sonodynamic Therapeutics with Bioorthogonal-Based Mitochondria-Specific Exogenous Agents toward Accurate Tumor Elimination.,"Sonodynamic therapy (SDT) mediated by endogenous stimuli-activated sonosensitizing prodrugs is faced with problems such as low specificity, tumor heterogeneity, and uncontrollability. Utilizing bioorthogonal reactions as exogenous stimuli to programmatically activate the prodrugs has been identified as a potential solution to these problems. Herein, we present a mitochondria-specific sonosensitizing system for programmatically controllable activation of sonodynamic therapeutics based on the Staudinger reaction by rationally designing a mitochondrial-targeting bioorthogonal trigger (TP) and a mitochondria-targeting sonosensitizing nanoprodrug (MA-NPs). The MA-NPs is enriched inside the mitochondria of the tumor cell driven by the mitochondrial membrane potential. The enrichment of MA-NPs and the subsequently loaded TP within mitochondria initiate Staudinger reactions, which promote the disintegration of MA-NPs to release sonosenitizing methylene blue (MB). Then, under ultrasound irradiation, MB produces reactive oxygen species (ROS) to damage the mitochondria of tumor cells and induce apoptosis, which effectively inhibits tumor development and facilitates the effects of SDT. This research presents an innovative strategy for the advancement of exogenous activation agents capable of selectively and efficiently activating prosonosensitizers and achieving controllable and effective SDT.",ACS applied materials & interfaces,2025,downloaded,10.1021/acsami.5c04425
40499230,Electron acceptor motif-manipulated NIR-II AIE photosensitizers synergically induce tumor pyroptosis through multimodal image-guided pure type I photodynamic and photothermal therapy.,"Pyroptosis, a form of programmed cell death, is known for its strong capacity to induce immunogenic cell death (ICD), triggering the release of damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) that amplify cancer immunotherapy. Recently, photocontrolled pyroptosis has emerged as a promising strategy within photodynamic therapy (PDT). Nonetheless, most existing photosensitizers exhibit a reliance on both type I and type II reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, which not only leads to suboptimal efficacy in hypoxic tumor environments but also limits therapeutic depth and selectivity. In this study, we report a lysosome-targeted aggregation-induced emission (AIE) photosensitizer, PTQ-TPA3, engineered through receptor unit loop fusion and rotor integration via molecular evolution strategies. PTQ-TPA3 uniquely achieves highly efficient pure type I ROS generation, alongside near-infrared-II (NIR-II) fluorescence emission and photothermal conversion properties. Under the guidance of multimodal imaging modalities, including photoacoustic, NIR-II fluorescence, and photothermal imaging, PTQ-TPA3 nanoparticles enable synergistic photodynamic and photothermal therapy to drive robust ICD-mediated phototherapy. Furthermore, PTQ-TPA3 demonstrates exceptional efficacy in hypoxic tumor environments by producing pure type I ROS while leveraging its photothermal effect to induce pyroptosis. This dual mechanism effectively eradicates cancer cells and stimulates systemic antitumor immunity, paving the way for innovative therapeutic strategies.",Biomaterials,2026,downloaded,10.1016/j.biomaterials.2025.123490
40480041,A multimodal imaging nanobubble enhancing sonodynamic therapy by cell membrane disruption for effective anti-melanoma.,"Sonodynamic therapy (SDT) offers a new, non-invasive therapeutic choice for melanoma. However, direct use of sonosensitizer like chlorin e6 (Ce6) may face problems like poor drug solubility and off-target effects. Besides, using SDT alone may be deficient to treat melanoma. Nanobubbles (NBs) are novel extravascular ultrasound contrast agents with the ability to perform ultrasound-triggered drug delivery. On the other hand, we found that cell membrane disruption therapy is suitable for working synergistically with SDT. In this study, we used quaternary ammonium salts (QAS) to prepare NBs with therapeutic effect. Besides delivering Ce6, QAS NBs can destroy tumor cell membranes using its special structure, thus enhancing the effect of SDT. The resulting Ce6@QAS NBs had excellent ultrasound-triggered imaging effects and photoacoustic (PA) imaging effects both in vivo and in vitro. The effect in killing tumor cells has been confirmed, including the performance to destroy cells by their outer QAS shells, and the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in SDT process. We found that treated tumor cells were induced to undergo immunogenic cell death (ICD). In the Ce6@QAS NBs with ultrasound group, the tumor growth was significantly inhibited, and anti-tumor immunity was activated. These results suggest that Ce6@QAS NBs can achieve physicochemical synergistic antitumor therapy while performing multimodal imaging.",Biomaterials,2026,downloaded,10.1016/j.biomaterials.2025.123450
40465209,Spatiotemporal Charging Single-Atom Nanozymes Activated Pyroptosis for Antitumor Immunotherapy via Bioorthogonal Disruption of Succination and Reinvigorating T Lymphocytes.,"Pyroptosis can trigger strong immunogenic cell death (ICD) of tumor cells for antitumor immunotherapy. However, metabolic disorders of fumarate in the tumor microenvironment (TME) can significantly reduce the pyroptosis rate and render T lymphocytes dysfunctional. Here, the ultrasound (US)-driven piezoelectric charges assisted Fe-based SAzyme (BFTM) with co-loaded triphenylphosphonium (TPP) and methyl (Z)-4-(chloro(2-phenylhydrazono)methyl)benzoate (MMB, a bioorthogonal reagent of fumarate) for activating pyroptosis and regulating fumarate metabolism is developed. Positive and negative charges generated by barium titanate (BTO) regulate the electron cloud density of single-Fe atom, endowing the BFTM with efficient reactive oxygen species (ROS) production ability for triggering caspase-1 related gasdermin D (GSDMD) mediated pyroptosis. Meanwhile, the consumption of intracellular fumarate through bioorthogonal reaction not only prevented the succinate of cysteines in GSDMD, causing it to be activated and oligomerized by caspase-1 to enhance pyroptosis but also restored the phosphorylation of ZAP70 to normalize the T cell receptor (TCR) signaling pathways for reinvigorating CD8+ T cells. In short, US-driven BFTM as a pyroptosis initiator and metabolism immune activator significantly enhances antitumor immunotherapy effects via ROS storms, fumarate depletion, triggering pyroptosis, and reinvigorating T lymphocytes.","Advanced materials (Deerfield Beach, Fla.)",2025,downloaded,10.1002/adma.202502940
40434189,Spatial-Constraint Modulation of Intra/Extracellular Reactive Oxygen Species by Adaptive Hybrid Materials for Boosting Pyroptosis and Combined Immunotherapy of Breast Tumor.,"Pyroptosis-immunotherapy has potential for triple-negative breast cancer treatment, but its efficacy is limited by insufficient pyroptosis activation and the need for phased, balanced, and spatially controlled activation of active species during long-term treatment. To reconcile intracellular/extracellular demands in tumor ablation, a nanoparticle-hydrogel hybrid enabling spatiotemporal reactive oxygen species (ROS) modulation is engineered. An open-shell sonosensitizer with unpaired electrons in its molecular orbitals is prepared by chelating Cu2⁺ with TCPP. These sonosensitizers are undergoing bovine serum albumin mediated biomineralization to form calcium phosphate particles and are incorporated into an injectable hydrogel through Schiff base crosslinking between dopamine-functionalized oxidized hyaluronic acid and gallic acid-modified chitosan. After intratumoral injection, nanoparticles endocytosed into tumor cells undergo acidic degradation, releasing calcium ions and GSH-activatable sonosensitizers. Calcium overload synergizes with ultrasound-mediated oxidative stress to induce mitochondrial damage and pyroptosis, while adhesive hydrogels retained in the extracellular matrix control excessive secondary ROS levels to protect oxidation-sensitive entities. This dual-action mechanism enhances the overall therapeutic effect by combining immediate tumor killing with long-term immune activation. This study provides a new route to hybrid material design, addressing the conflicting demands of short-term tumor ablation and long-term immune activation, overcoming the limitations of current pyroptosis-based immunotherapies.",Advanced healthcare materials,2025,downloaded,10.1002/adhm.202500371
40426022,Cascade Catalytic Nanozymes Induce Tumor Ca2+ Overload and Ferroptosis by Reducing Energy Supply and Amplifying Oxidative Stress.,"Nanozyme-mediated nanocatalytic therapy, by mimicking the activity of redox enzymes, generates highly toxic reactive oxygen species (ROS) within tumor cells, thereby opening a pathway for tumor-specific therapy. However, achieving satisfactory therapeutic outcomes with nanozymes remains challenging due to the inherent complexity of the tumor microenvironment (TME). In this context, we designed a two-dimensional layered double hydroxide (LDH) nanozyme loaded with Au nanoparticles, while incorporating bioactive Ca2+ and Fe3+ ions (denoted as MgCaFe-LDH@Au NSs) to target the specific needs of the TME. The designed nanozyme mimics glucose oxidase to facilitate self-sufficient H2O2 production and simulates catalase and glutathione peroxidase to overcome the adverse conditions of hypoxia and elevated GSH levels in the TME. Subsequently, the nanozyme emulates peroxidase activity to generate ROS, amplifying oxidative stress and causing redox imbalance, ultimately inducing ferroptosis in tumor cells. Moreover, MgCaFe-LDH@Au NSs also function as an inorganic semiconductor sonosensitizer with a tunable band structure, enabling the generation of abundant ROS under ultrasound irradiation to achieve synergistic sonodynamic and catalytic therapy. Notably, the high levels of ROS induced by the nanozyme, along with the interference in tumor ATP synthesis, enhanced the calcium overload in the TME caused by the release of Ca2+ from the nanozyme. In summary, this two-dimensional nanomaterial, through nanozyme and ultrasound-catalyzed synergistic disruption of tumor energy supply and redox balance, exhibited significant therapeutic efficacy in a 4T1 tumor-bearing mouse model. This study also highlights the immense potential of multimetal LDHs as inducers of calcium overload and ferroptosis in tumor therapy.",ACS applied materials & interfaces,2025,downloaded,10.1021/acsami.5c04041.s001
40423093,Platelet Membrane-Coated Drug-Loaded Nanoparticles for Dual-Modal Imaging and Photodynamic Therapy in Triple-Negative Breast Cancer.,"Photodynamic therapy (PDT) has emerged as a promising strategy for cancer treatment; however, its efficacy is hindered by the hypoxic tumor microenvironment. In this study, we designed a bionic nanosystem to enhance oxygen-dependent PDT. The system comprises Fe-doped polydiaminopyridine (Fe-PDAP) nanoenzymes with catalase-like activity, encapsulated with metformin (Met) and indocyanine green (ICG). The surface of the nanoparticles was further coated with platelet membranes (PM), enabling targeted delivery to the tumor site via molecular recognition. In vitro and in vivo studies demonstrated that Fe-PDAP nanoenzymes catalyzed the generation of O2 from elevated hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) while concurrently depleting glutathione (GSH), resulting in increased production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and enhanced PDT efficacy. Met, acting as a mitochondrial respiratory inhibitor, disrupts complex I of the electron transport chain, thereby reducing ATP levels, inhibiting oxygen (O2) consumption at the tumor site, and amplifying the PDT effect.

40357877,Ultrasound-Triggered Nanoparticles Induce Cuproptosis for Enhancing Immunogenic Sonodynamic Therapy.,"Cuproptosis, as a novel mechanism of cell death, holds significant promise for tumor therapy. However, existing studies typically employ methods to induce cuproptosis through endogenous or exogenous pathways, which often fail to achieve precise control in both space and time. Herein, polymeric nanoparticles (RC NPs) are developed that enable precise activation of cuproptosis through acoustic control for tumor-specific treatment. The nanoparticles are fabricated via self-assembly of a degradable, acoustic-sensitive polymer (Poly RA) and a metal-ion-loadable polyphenol-structured polymer (Poly MPN). Ultrasound stimulation cleaved the RC NPs, generating reactive oxygen species (ROS) and promoting the release of copper ions from Poly MPN, leading to the aggregation of lipoylated proteins and depletion of iron-sulfur cluster proteins to introduce cuproptosis. Subsequently, the RC NPs successfully activated the immune system of mice, promoting the maturation of antigen-presenting cells and the activation of T lymphocytes. The nanoparticles exhibited good biosafety and significant tumor inhibition in both orthotopic and patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models. These novel nanoparticles provide a promising modality for the treatment of highly aggressive cancers and a valuable avenue for future clinical applications.","Advanced materials (Deerfield Beach, Fla.)",2025,downloaded,10.1002/adma.202504228
40356359,Ultrasound-Responsive Lipid Nanosonosensitizers with Size Reduction and NO Release: Synergistic Sonodynamic-Chemo-Immunotherapy for Pancreatic Tumors.,"Pancreatic cancer (PC) remains difficult to treat due to its dense extracellular matrix (ECM), immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME), and deep-seated anatomy. To address these challenges, we developed IR&ZnPc@LNP-NO, an ultrasound (US)-responsive lipid nanosonosensitizer that synergizes sonodynamic therapy (SDT), chemotherapy, and immunotherapy for orthotopic PC. IR&ZnPc@LNP-NO undergoes three key US-activated responses: 1) size reduction, 2) controlled release of irinotecan (IR) and nitric oxide (NO), and 3) generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Under low-dose US, IR&ZnPc@LNP-NO reduces in size (from ∼120  to ∼40 nm), enhancing tumor penetration, and releases NO to remodel the TME by normalizing vasculature and degrading ECM. This enhances nanosonosensitizers accumulation and cytotoxic T cells (CTLs) infiltration. High-dose US irradiation triggers the generation of cytotoxic ROS, which, in combination with IR-mediated chemotherapy, induces immunogenic cell death (ICD) and enhances antitumor immunity. Additionally, combining IR&ZnPc@LNP-NO with PD-L1 antibody (αPD-L1) immunotherapy significantly prolongs survival in orthotopic PC models. The cascade strategy-size reduction, TME remodeling, and multimodal therapy-effectively overcomes stromal and immunosuppressive barriers, offering a robust platform for treating deep-seated PC.",Angewandte Chemie (International ed. in English),2025,downloaded,10.1002/anie.202507388
40344878,Tumor microenvironment responsive nano-PROTAC for BRD4 degradation enhanced cancer photo-immunotherapy.,"Proteolysis Targeting Chimeras (PROTAC) technology has garnered great attention due to its advantages in targeted protein degradation, promising its potential for treating malignant cancer. Nevertheless, the inherent drawbacks of PROTAC technology hinder its clinical translation. The integration of nanotechnology with PROTAC molecules to create nano-PROTACs for combined therapy offers a promising solution. Among the various cancer treatment methods, phototherapy is considered the optimal choice to integrate with specific PROTACs due to its proven effectiveness and non-invasive nature. Herein, a nano-PROTAC formulation (ARV@PEG-ICG) consisting of a phototherapeutic agent named indocyanine green functionalized polyethylene glycol (PEG-ICG) and a BRD4 degrader (ARV-825) was fabricated for cancer photo-immunotherapy. Activated by acidic tumor microenvironment (TME), ARV@PEG-ICG nanoparticles (NPs) will decompose rapidly for ARV delivery. PEG-ICG generated abundant ROS with laser irradiation, downregulating the expression of Bcl-xL and inducing the cleavage of PARP to stimulate cell apoptosis. Furthermore, the degradation of BRD4, a transcriptional cofactor, inhibited nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) generation to improve phototherapeutic efficacy. In a 4T1 breast tumor model, dying 4T1 cells released tumor associated antigens (TAAs) to serve as the immunogenic cell death (ICD) inducer, facilitating DC maturation and T cell activation and amplifying systemic immune response. The distant tumor growth can also be inhibited due to the activation of long-term immune response. Overall, the current study aims to combine typical PROTAC with functional nanomaterials to form nano-PROTAC with high performance for PROTAC delivery mediated cancer treatment.",Biomaterials,2025,downloaded,10.1016/j.biomaterials.2025.123387

Herein, tumor-acidity and photothermal controlled nanosystems (NTTD), which coloaded a new type of sonosensitizers, Na3TiF6 NPs and second near-infrared (NIR-II) emissive AIEgen (T1), have been developed to achieve highly efficient SDT/photothermal therapy (PTT) in deep-seated tumors. On one hand, NTTD includes ultrasmall Na3TiF6 NPs with increased oxygen vacancies, narrow bandgap (2.82 eV) and preferrable absorption capability of H2O and O2 molecules, guaranteeing powerful generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) under US stimulation. On the other hand, with the assistance of the acidic/photothermal responses and deep penetrated NIR-II fluorescence imaging (up to 7 mm), NTTD undergo in situ ""two-step"" size transformation to achieve enhanced retention and penetration of sonosensitizers in tumor area with high spatiotemporal controllability. In 4T1 tumor model, compared to passive targeting participated NTT group, NTTD elongated the tumor retention time to 60 h and revealed enhanced imaging signal (∼2.4 fold). Further photoirradiation of NTTD assisted ∼4.5-fold enhancement of penetration ability. SDT/PTT synergies have evoked significant ROS generation and tumor inhibition rate of 75.2 % in vivo.

Selenium (Se) has obvious antitumor effects, but the sensitizing effect and mechanism of Se nanoparticles in ESCC radiotherapy remain to be determined. The aim of this study was to investigate which form of Se have superior sensitization of ESCC and to investigate how Se nanoparticles (LNT-SeNPs) can enhance the radiosensitivity of ESCC. Our findings indicate that LNT-SeNPs exhibit remarkable radiosensitizing activity with a higher safety index. These nanoparticles effectively inhibit cell growth, induce S-phase arrest, and promote apoptosis through increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. Furthermore, analysis via the GEO database revealed the correlation between the selenoprotein GPX2 and the radiosensitivity of esophageal cancer. Further investigations demonstrate that LNT-SeNPs suppress GPX2 expression, leading to apoptosis in ESCC cells via the p53/IGFBP3 signaling pathway. In conclusion, this study elucidates that LNT-SeNPs can enhance the effectiveness of radiotherapy for esophageal cancer, providing valuable insights into the potential use of Se-based drugs as adjunctive therapy.

Radioresistant hypoxic regions can be precisely identified and treated without the use of high doses of radiation if hypoxic region-specific contrast agents have a therapeutic effect. In this study, we synthesized a therapeutic-diagnostic complex agent (SPION-PG-NI) by combining polyglycerol-functionalized superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (SPION-PG, core diameter of 8.8 ± 1.9 nm) as an MRI contrast agent and 2-nitroimidazole (NI, a pimonidazole derivative) as a hypoxia-targeted ligand to visually evaluate hypoxic regions using MRI and improve radiotherapy efficacy at those sites. SPION-PG-NI showed a concentration-dependent contrast effect and had significantly higher accumulation in subcutaneous glioblastomas than the control agent, SPION-PG, 24 h after administration. Immunohistological evaluations showed that the SPION-PG-NI-accumulated regions corresponded well to hypoxic regions. SPION-PG-NI showed neither migration into the brain parenchyma nor neurotoxicity. Both SPION-PG and SPION-PG-NI decrease reactive oxygen species (ROS); however, they improve radiotherapy efficacy in hypoxic glioblastoma cells due to cytotoxicity. This effect of SPION-PG-NI was significantly higher than that of SPION-PG (p < 0.01). After 12 Gy irradiation, the mean normalized glioblastoma tumor volume on day 38 in the SPION-PG-NI group (288%) was significantly lower than that in the control group (882%) (p < 0.05). Collectively, these findings suggest the potential of SPION-PG-NI as a useful and safe tumor theranostic nanodevice for hypoxic imaging and improving radiotherapy efficacy.",ACS nano,2025,downloaded,10.1021/acsnano.4c06753

Chemotherapy combined with immunotherapy is the first-line treatment for breast cancer, but it still suffers from limited therapeutic efficiency and serious side effects, which are usually due to the poor delivery efficiency, drug resistance of tumor cells, and immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment. This study explores the development of ultrasound-responsive nanobubbles (Ce6/PTX Nbs) for targeted imaging and sonoimmunotherapy in breast cancer treatment. By integrating sonodynamic therapy (SDT), chemotherapy, and immunotherapy, the nanobubbles aim to address challenges such as poor drug delivery, systemic toxicity, and immune suppression in conventional therapies. The nanobubbles, composed of sonosensitizer chlorin e6 (Ce6)-modified phospholipid and loaded with the chemotherapeutic agent paclitaxel (PTX) enhancing drug-loading capacity, are designed to precisely target tumor sites via cyclic-RGD peptides. Upon ultrasound activation, Ce6 induces reactive oxygen species (ROS), promoting immunogenic cell death (ICD), while PTX disrupts tumor cell mitosis, enhancing the immune response. The nanobubbles' ultrasound responsiveness facilitates real-time imaging and controlled drug release, maximizing therapeutic efficacy while minimizing side effects. Key findings demonstrate that Ce6/PTX Nbs significantly reduced tumor growth in a 4T1 breast cancer model, enhanced immune activation via the cGAS-STING pathway, and increased the infiltration of CD8+ T cells in both primary and distant tumors. In combination with anti-PD-L1 checkpoint inhibitors, the treatment achieved a substantial suppression of tumor metastasis.

Herein, a disulfide bond linked homodimer, Cy1280, which is modulated by albumin to accurately balance the fluorescence and ROS generation and exhibit a weak fluorescence and sealed PDT effect during blood circulation, is exploited. Cy1280 can be specifically internalized and dispersed at the tumor site via Organic Anion Transporter Proteins (OATPs) and thiol-disulfide exchange mediated synergistic uptake and activated after mild sunlight irradiation (100 ± 5 Klx) to sensitize neighboring oxygen in cellular mitochondria to execute direct protein dysfunction effect. The dynamic covalent chemistry (DCC) facilitates prolonged and sustained retention in tumors (>336 h) and demonstrates the efficacy of imaging-guided solid-tumor therapy in tumor-bearing BALB/C mice. This study resolves the inevitable stubborn impotent tumor penetration caused by bulky-sized nanoparticles and high interstitial pressure of tumor with synergistic uptake manner, the long-term circulation and sealed PDT manipulated with albumin also improve the whole body phototoxic symptom.

Herein, a magnetic microrobot based on living Spirulina Platensis (SP), which is coated with a double layer of Fe3O4 nanoparticles (NPs) and CaCO3 NPs. The microrobots can accumulate in tumor regions under magnetic attraction, which produces a high-Ca2+ environment under the acidic TME and facilitates Ca2+ overload under ultrasound (US) stimulation.

Among these, agents featuring second near-infrared (NIR-II) emission are particularly appealing due to their superior tissue penetration depth and high signal-to-background ratio (SBR). However, most reported NIR-II fluorophores suffer from severely imbalanced radiative and non-radiative excited-state energy dissipation in biological environments, resulting in extremely low fluorescence quantum yields (QYs) and limited diagnostic efficacy. This highlights the urgent need for innovative molecular design strategies to develop high-performance NIR-II ""one-for-all"" multimodal phototheranostic agents. Herein, we present, for the first time, a multi-dimensional donor engineering protocol that optimizes donor design at the molecular, aggregated, and solvent-interaction levels. By introducing 2,4,4-trimethylpentan-2-yl groups into the diphenylamine indeno[1,2-b]thiophene donor unit, we developed a donor-acceptor-donor (D-A-D) type NIR-II aggregation-induced emission-active luminogen (AIEgen), i.e. OPITBT. When formulated into nanoparticles (NPs), OPITBT NPs exhibited a 16-fold enhancement in fluorescence QY compared to OPITBT in tetrahydrofuran, along with excellent photothermal conversion efficiency (PCE) and acceptable type-I reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation. When further fabricated into tumor-targeting NPs, the resulted OPITBT-R NPs effectively eliminated orthotopic breast cancer through fluorescence-photoacoustic-photothermal multimodal imaging-guided photodynamic-photothermal synergistic therapy under single 808 nm laser irradiation. Notably, the exceptional NIR-II fluorescence brightness of OPITBT-R NPs enables high-resolution NIR-IIb whole-body vascular imaging in living mice.

To overcome this limitation, this study introduces ZFPG nanoparticles (ZFPG NPs) with ZnFe2O4@Pt cores and glucose oxidase (GOx) shells. The ZFPG NPs possess five-enzyme activities, good sonosensitivity, and remarkable magnetic targeting properties, which facilitate sono-metallo-immunotherapy for prostate cancer treatment in male mice. Specifically, the magnetic targeting ability effectively improves their accumulation in tumors while still showing enrichment in the liver and kidneys. The multienzyme cascade catalysis and sonosensitivity of these NPs effectively deplete glutathione and glucose, and enhance the generation and utilization of H2O2, thereby inducing multiple ROS bursts. Furthermore, these comprehensive effects up-regulate the HMOX1 to promote the Fe2+ and lipid peroxides accumulation, thereby inducing immunogenic ferroptosis. This strategy facilitates anti-tumor immunity by ameliorating the immunosuppressive TME and inhibiting lung metastatic progression.

39960802,Acoustically Driven Hybrid Nanocrystals for In Vivo Pancreatic Cancer Treatment.,"New treatment strategies are urgently needed for pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), which is one of the deadliest tumors nowadays. PDAC is marked by hypoxia, intrinsic chemoresistance, a ""cold"" tumor microenvironment, and dense desmoplastic stroma, which hinders drug penetration. This study investigates the combined effect of iron-doped, lipid-coated zinc oxide nanoparticles enhanced with a fluorescent sonosensitizer and local ultrasound stimulation in treating PDAC. Nanoparticles were synthesized and coated by lipids, and their physiochemical properties were characterized by assessing reproducibility, stability, and efficient inclusion of the sonosensitizer. In vitro, sonosensitizer-enhanced nanoconstructs were tested on a KPC murine PDAC cell line in combination with ultrasound to evaluate their cytotoxicity and assess their efficacy. In vivo, NPs were further coupled with AlexaFluor 700 to allow their localization over time, and the nanoconstructs were intratumorally administered to a subcutaneous murine PDAC model to enhance local bioavailability and tumor visualization and minimize off-target effects of systemic delivery. Biodistribution, efficacy, flow cytometry, and survival studies were carried out on different cohorts of mice. The sonosensitizer-enhanced nanoconstructs, combined with ultrasound, triggered significant reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, reducing the KPC cell viability. In vivo, the antitumor efficacy was particularly pronounced with ultrasound stimulation, demonstrating a synergistic interaction between the nanoparticles and ultrasound. Moreover, increased immune cell infiltration, enhanced cancer cell apoptosis, and prolonged survival of the treated animals were achieved.

39950402,Tumor-Targeted Glutamine Metabolism Blocker Synergizes with TiO2-Au Janus Nanoparticles for Enhanced Sono-Metabolic Antitumor Therapy.,"Sonodynamic therapy (SDT) is a promising therapeutic modality known for its non-invasiveness, temporal-spatial controllability, and deeper tissue penetration. However, the SDT treatment efficacy is still hampered by the scarcity of ideal sonosensitizers and complex tumor microenvironment (TME). To address these challenges, a sono-metabolic nano-composite (TiO2-Au@DON) using the metabolic reprogramming prodrugs of 6-Diazo-5-oxo-l-norleucine (DON) grafted on TiO2-Au Janus nanoparticles (NPs) is fabricated. The coupling of TiO2 and gold in the TiO2-Au@DON effectively prevents the fast recombination of excited electrons and holes under ultrasound irradiation. The result is the generation of higher levels of both type I and II reactive oxygen species (ROS) compared to pure TiO2, which helps overcome the limitations of SDT in the hypoxic TME. Furthermore, the TiO2-Au Janus NPs act as nano-carriers, delivering DON prodrugs to the tumor site. The released DON can disrupt nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate hydrogen (NADPH) and tumor redox homeostasis by reprogramming the metabolic pathways while it intensifies the activities of immune cells. This metabolic disruption amplifies SDT-mediated oxidative stress, resulting in the increase of tumor sensitivity to ROS through TiO2-Au@DON-integrated synergistic effects of SDT and glutamine reprogramming strategies. This increased sensitivity ultimately induces robust immunogenic cell death (ICD), enhancing antitumor therapeutic efficacy and remodeling the tumor's immunosuppressive microenvironment.","Advanced materials (Deerfield Beach, Fla.)",2025,downloaded,10.1002/adma.202418800

Herein, a liquid-phase stripping technique was introduced as a simple reflux method for synthesizing ultrasmall Mn-PCN-224 nanodots (MM NDs). Compared with PCN-224 nanodots, the synthesized MM NDs, which function as renal-clearable nanoagents, produced 2.42 times more reactive oxygen species (ROS) under identical ultrasound (US) irradiation conditions. In vivo and in vitro experiments revealed that A549 lung cancer cells treated with MM NDs under US irradiation and H2O2 exhibited a relative cell viability of ∼9% and a tumor inhibition rate of ∼91%. This result demonstrates that MM NDs can efficiently increase the effectiveness of SDT by leveraging their catalase-like activity and ultrasmall size (4 nm) to prevent ROS quenching. Furthermore, these nanoagents could be effectively utilized for photoacoustic (PA) imaging to track their accumulation in tumors and monitor the alleviation of the hypoxic tumor microenvironment. Notably, MM ND-mediated SDT demonstrated superior penetration depth compared to PDT, making it more effective in inhibiting contralateral tumors while facilitating deep-tissue treatment.

However, such tiny-sized CDs tend to be rapidly excreted by the kidney and/or hepatobiliary system before reaching the tumor site, which may significantly weaken their performance in tumor theranostics. Here, fluorescence switchable iron-doped carbon dot assemblies (FCDDs) are developed with an average size of ≈120 nm for passive tumor targeting. After lesional enrichment, FCDDs can be dissembled into Fe-doped CDs (FCDs) with fluorescence switched on, in response to the upregulated glutathione (GSH) in the tumor microenvironment. The ultrasmall FCDs are able to penetrate into the deep region of solid tumors and generate reactive oxygen species (ROS) through the Fenton reaction. Such ROS accumulation and GSH deprivation caused by FCDDs can effectively trigger the irreversible apoptosis and ferroptosis of tumor cells. Meanwhile, the resultant intracellular redox dyshomeostasis induces prominent immunogenic cell death to prevent metastasis. Tumor-specific fluorescence imaging not only enables cancerous tissue probing but also assists in monitoring the treatment effectiveness. Taken together, this paradigm exemplifies a practical approach to improve the functionality of CDs toward clinical applications and may inspire more facile designs toward upcoming translational medicines.",Advanced healthcare materials,2025,downloaded,10.1002/adhm.202500083

Despite the initial success of traditional treatments for BCL in clinical trials, a majority of patients eventually develop resistance to therapy and have poor clinical outcomes. Epigenetic dysregulation is a major contributor to the pathogenesis of BCL, and therapies targeting epigenetic pathways is a promising alternative strategy for treating BCL. Herein, we developed a metal-organic framework (MOF)-based nano-sonosensitizer for ultrasound-driven cascade immunotherapy against BCL. The nano-sonosensitizer was synthesized by encapsulating copper complex of the m6A-mRNA demethylase inhibitor into UiO-66-NH2, which possesses a Z-scheme heterostructure and allows efficient electron-hole pair separation for generating reactive oxygen species (ROS) under ultrasound activation. These CuR@UiO66 sonosensitizers were functionalized with mPEG-PO3 and anti-CD19 antibody, and the resulting CRUPPA19 particles could specifically accumulate in the BCL tissue and also target lymphoma cells that infiltrated into the bone marrow. Once internalized, CRUPPA19 could induce intracellular ROS production and apoptosis under ultrasound irradiation. Subsequently, ultrasonic stimulation triggered autophagy-mediated release of Cu and Rhein from CRUPPA19, thereby increasing protein lipoylation and global mRNA methylation, which led to cuproptosis and the transcriptional repression PDL1, respectively. These cascades synergistically induced immunogenic cell death in the tumors and promoted activation of CD8+ T cells, eventually leading to an antilymphoma immune response. CRUPPA19-mediated sono-immunotherapy not only eliminated the primary and metastatic lymphomas but also cleared lymphoma cells from the bone marrow.

Herein, a living drug sprinkle biohybrid (YB1-HCNs) was constructed by hitching acid/enzyme-triggered detachable nanoparticles (HCNs) backpack on the surface of metabolic oligosaccharide-engineered oncolytic bacteria YB1. Along with the process of tumor penetration by bacterial hypoxia navigation, YB1-HCNs responsively and continuously release HCNs, achieving a uniform distribution of loaded agents throughout the tumor. Upon successive irradiation of laser and ultrasound (US), the HCNs can separately generate type II and type I ROS for superior sono-photodynamic therapy (SPDT), which enables HCNs to synergize with YB1 for a satisfactory therapeutic effect in both superficial normoxic and deep hypoxic regions of the tumor. After a single dose, this efficient combination realized 98.3% primary tumor inhibition rate and prolonged survival of mice for 90 days with no recurrence, further inducing a powerful immunological memory effect to completely suppress tumor rechallenge in cured mice. Such a bacterial hybridization vector enables optimization of the spatial distribution of YB1 and HCNs, providing an innovative strategy to maximize therapeutic outcomes and evoke durable antitumor immunity.",ACS nano,2025,downloaded,10.1021/acsnano.4c16740

In this study, we developed tumor microenvironment-responsive nanoparticles (GdNPs) to enhance SDT effectiveness through epigenetic reprogramming of the TME by encapsulating the sonosensitizer chlorin e6 (Ce6) and the histone deacetylase 6 (HDAC6) inhibitor Ricolinostat (Ric) (GdNPs/Ce6-Ric). GdNPs/Ce6-Ric effectively accumulate at tumor sites via the enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect and release Ce6 and Ric in response to the acidic TME. Upon ultrasound stimulation, GdNPs/Ce6-Ric induce cancer cell apoptosis and trigger ICD by generating reactive oxygen species (ROS), which activate cytotoxic T cells and promote tumor cell elimination. Notably, the epigenetic modulation by Ric within the immunosuppressive TME increased the proportion of natural killer (NK) cells and cytotoxic T cells while decreasing the population of immunosuppressive regulatory T (Treg) cells. This modulation synergistically enhanced the anti-tumor effects of SDT by downregulating the HDAC6/p-STAT3/PD-L1 pathway. Furthermore, GdNPs/Ce6-Ric minimized lung metastases by not only improving systemic immune responses but also inhibiting TGFβ-induced epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) of tumor cells through the blockade of α-tubulin deacetylation.

Herein, we introduce an innovative nanobioelectronic system combining a piezoelectric barium titanate nanoparticle core with a conducting poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) shell (BTO@PEDOT NPs), designed to modulate cancer cell bioelectricity through noninvasive, wireless stimulation. Our hypothesis is that acting as nanoantennas, BTO@PEDOT NPs convert mechanical inputs provided by ultrasound (US) into electrical signals, capable of interfering with the bioelectronic circuitry of two human breast cancer cell lines, MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231. Upon US stimulation, the viability of MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells treated with 200 μg mL-1 BTO@PEDOT NPs and US reduced significantly to 31% and 24%, respectively, while healthy human mammary fibroblasts (HMF) were unaffected by the treatment. Subsequent assays shed light on how this approach could interact with cell's bioelectrical mechanisms, namely, by increasing intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) and calcium concentrations. Furthermore, this system was able to polarize cancer cell membranes, halting their cell cycle and potentially harnessing their tumorigenic characteristics.

Result: We employed polylactic-co-glycolic acid (PLGA) as a delivery vector for the encapsulation of indocyanine green (ICG), a photosensitizer, and perfluorohexane (PFH), with surface labeling mannose to facilitate targeted delivery. A potential therapeutic nanoplatform was fabricated, designated as Man-PFH-ICG@PLGA. These nanospheres are capable of localizing at tumor sites and can be tracked using photoacoustic (PA) imaging. Upon laser irradiation, the ROS generated by PDT activated the transient receptor potential cation channel subfamily A member 1 (TRPA1) located on the cell membrane. This activation led to an influx of extracellular Ca2+ and subsequently resulted in calcium overload. The excessive Ca2+ selectively accumulated in mitochondria, disrupting the function of enzymes involved in the mitochondrial respiratory chain. This disruption inhibits cellular respiration and decreases oxygen consumption in tumor cells, ultimately contributing to the alleviation of the hypoxic microenvironment within tumors. Simultaneously, PFH exhibited a high affinity for oxygen and can deliver exogenous oxygen directly to the tumor site through simple diffusion along the concentration gradient. Both the direct and indirect mechanisms synergistically contribute to ameliorating the hypoxic conditions within tumors, thereby augmenting the efficacy of PDT. Conclusions: The synergistic effect of photocontrolled calcium overload from endogenous sources and the oxygen-carrying nanoplatform alleviates tumor hypoxia, thereby enhancing the efficacy of PDT. This approach provides a new perspective on PDT.",ACS applied materials & interfaces,2025,downloaded,10.1021/acsami.4c21452

However, it is highly challenging to design efficient PSs with high luminescence and phototherapy performance simultaneously. In this study, a spiro-functionalization strategy is proposed to alleviate aggregate-caused quenching of PSs and promote photodynamic therapy, and the strategy is verified via a spiro[fluorine-9,9'-xanthene]-modified NIR-II PS (named SFX-IC) with an acceptor-donor-acceptor configuration. SFX-IC-based nanoparticles (NPs) display a high molar extinction coefficient of 7.05 × 104 m‒1 cm-1 at 645 nm due to strong intramolecular charge-transfer characteristics. As expected, the as-prepared NPs show strong NIR-II emission with a fluorescence quantum yield of 1.1%, thanks to the spiro-configuration that suppressing excessively intermolecular π-π stacking. Furthermore, SFX-IC NPs not only efficiently generate 1O2 and O∙- 2 under 660 nm laser irradiation, but also possess good photothermal effect with photothermal conversion efficiency of 47.14%. Consequently, SFX-IC NPs can be served as versatile phototheranostic agents for NIR-II fluorescence/photoacoustic imaging-guided phototherapy, manifesting that the spiro-functionalized strategy is a powerful tool to construct efficient NIR-II emitting PSs.",Advanced healthcare materials,2025,downloaded,10.1002/adhm.202404783

To address this challenge, we developed a hybrid nanoassembly with a distinct core-satellite-like heterostructure, PLAF@P/T-PD, which is responsive to both internal pH/redox and external ultrasound stimulations. This heterostructural nanoassembly features a polymersome core encapsulating an ultrasound contrast agent perfluoropentane and a chemotherapeutic agent Taxol (PLAF@P/T) electrostatically coated with satellite-like polyplexes carrying an immune agonist dsDNA (PD), which brings about synergistic functions inside the pancreatic tumor. The PLAF@P/T core functions as an enhancer for intratumor delivery through size enlargement and charge conversion in response to reactive oxygen species (ROS) and low pH, which triggers polyplex release and enables ultrasound-assisted tumor-penetrating Taxol delivery. Meanwhile, the released cationic polyplexes function as nucleic nanomedicine preferentially engulfed by peripheral dendritic cells (DCs) for immune modulation. Animal studies in mouse orthotopic pancreatic tumor model demonstrated exceptional therapeutic efficacy against both primary and metastatic tumors, which underlines the potential of this heterostructural nanoplatform for overcoming the therapeutic challenges associated with the heterogeneous physical barrier hindering intratumor drug delivery in pancreatic cancer treatment.",ACS nano,2025,downloaded,10.1021/acsnano.4c15444

In view of the undiversified molecular skeletons and insufficient phototheranostic outputs of previously reported NIR-II fluorophores, herein, electron acceptor engineering based on heteroatom-inserted rigid-planar pyrazinoquinoxaline was manipulated to fabricate aggregation-induced emission (AIE)-featured NIR-II counterparts with donor-acceptor-donor (D-A-D) architecture. Systematical investigations substantiated that one of those synthesized AIE molecules, namely 4TPQ, incorporating a fused thiophene acceptor, synchronously exhibited high molar absorptivity (ε), NIR-II emission, typical AIE tendency, significant reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, and high photothermal conversion efficiency. These extraordinary behaviors endowed 4TPQ nanoparticles with unprecedented performance on NIR-II fluorescence/photothermal imaging-navigated synergistic photodynamic/photothermal inhibition of tumors, as confirmed by the mice model of breast cancer bone metastases.

However, achieving spatiotemporally controlled release of chemotherapeutic agents during ROS generation is still an enormous challenge. In this work, we developed a cascade-activated nanoprodrug (CAN) system that utilizes a reversible covalent Schiff base mixed with a hypoxia-activatable camptothecin (CPT) prodrug. Briefly, the designed fluorinated CAN system is self-assembled into nanoparticles under aqueous conditions, which could penetrate deep tumors to offer sufficient oxygen for ultrasound-triggered ROS production. Consequently, the nanoparticles substantially exacerbated the hypoxia of the tumor microenvironment (TME) by elevating oxygen consumption. The aggravated hypoxia in turn served as a positive amplifier to boost the tumor-specific CPT release of Azo-CPT prodrug, which made up for the insufficient treatment efficacy of sonodynamic therapy (SDT). On this basis, we observed a substantial reduction, approximately 3.5-fold, in the half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) of the CAN system compared to that of free CPT in bladder cancer cell lines (T24). Furthermore, the CAN system demonstrated potent antitumor efficacy with reduced side effects, resulting in regression and eradication of T24 tumors in various mouse models. In summary, the CAN system can be easily extended by incorporating different chemotherapeutic agents, showing great potential to revolutionize the clinical management paradigm of bladder cancer.",ACS nano,2024,downloaded,10.1021/acsnano.4c12967
39660733,Ultrasound-Triggered Nanogel Boosts Chemotherapy and Immunomodulation in Colorectal Cancer.,"Chemotherapy is the primary therapy for colorectal cancer. However, its efficacy has been limited by chemoresistance, which is mainly caused by inadequate intratumoral drug accumulation and immunosuppressive microenvironments. To address these limitations, we developed a low-intensity ultrasound (LIU)-controlled and charge-reversible nanogel (R-NG), utilizing conjugated chitosan-polypyrrole polymers linked via thioketal bonds, with TiO2 absorbed onto its surface. Following the loading of oxaliplatin, the Oxa-R-NGs were ultimately synthesized. In the acidic tumor environment, the protonation of the pyrrole ring triggered the conversion of Oxa-R-NG into a positively charged form, thereby enhancing tumor penetration and cellular internalization. Based on the charge conversion, intratumoral accumulating Oxa-R-NG was triggered by LIU to continuously generate reactive oxygen species (ROS), which not only disrupted thioketal bonds to liberate oxaliplatin but also regulated tumor-associated macrophage polarization. Consequently, Oxa-R-NG boosted the chemotherapy for colorectal cancer by improving intratumoral drug accumulation and reversing the local immunosuppressive microenvironment synergistically.",ACS applied materials & interfaces,2025,downloaded,10.1021/acsami.4c13358.s001

In the realm of oncology, organoplatinum-based supramolecular coordination complexes (SCCs) that can coload therapeutic agents and imaging molecules have emerged as promising candidates for multimodal theranostics of tumors. To address the challenges of tumor-targeted delivery and multimodal theranostics for SCCs, this study employs a cell membrane cloaking strategy to fabricate biomimetic metallacage nanoparticles (MCNPs) with multimodal imaging capabilities and homologous targeting capabilities. Specifically, a photosensitizer molecule (BTTP) containing AIE-active groups was assembled into a metallacage of C-BTTP through Pt-N coordination. This process endows the metallacage with strong NIR-II fluorescence in the aggregated state and significantly superior ROS generation compared to that of the precursor ligand. After being encapsulated with F127, the MCNPs were further cloaked with U87 cancer cell membranes, creating biomimetic MCNPs that achieve tumor-targeting capabilities. Verified by in vitro and in vivo experiments, MCNPs enable multimodal imaging and initiate immunotherapy under photothermal and photodynamic stimulation, leading to synergistic antitumor effects. Furthermore, the evaluation of immunogenic cell death and dendritic cell maturation rate in U87 tumor-bearing mice confirmed the mechanism of photothermal and photodynamic synergistic immunotherapy. This study provides an innovative strategy for enhancing the tumor-targeting and therapeutic efficiency of SCCs, offering a versatile strategy for efficient and minimally invasive theranostics of tumors.

However, their poor piezoelectricity, fast electron-hole pair recombination rate, and biological toxicity of piezoelectric materials limit the therapeutic effects of piezoelectric SDT. In this study, hollow ZnO (HZnO) nanospheres were synthesized by using a one-step method. The hollow structure facilitated the deformation of HZnO under stimulation by ultrasound mechanical force and increased the piezoelectric constant. Subsequently, black phosphorus quantum dots (BPQDs) and arginine-glycine-aspartic acid peptide (RGD)-poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) were combined with HZnO to further enhance the piezoelectric effect by constructing heterojunctions and enable tumor-targeting ability. During treatment, HZnO-BPQDs-PEG could degrade in an acidic tumor microenvironment and release Zn2+ and PO43- ions to induce pro-death autophagy. The ROS produced by SDT also accelerated autophagy and promoted ferroptosis in cancer cells. This study demonstrates that HZnO-BPQDs-PEG has a strong piezoelectric SDT effect and can effectively induce autophagy in cancer cells, providing a new idea for the design and application of piezoelectric materials for tumor therapy.",Journal of the American Chemical Society,2024,downloaded,10.1021/jacs.4c14489.s001

This study presents such nanotheranostic platform (177Lu-MFeCu@Tan) via co-assembling 177Lu radionuclide and tanshinone (Tan) into Fe/Cu dual-metal nanozyme (MFeCu). This platform simultaneously enables single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) imaging and a quadruple-synergistic tumor therapy approach, including internal radioisotope therapy (RIT), catalysis therapy, chemotherapy, and MFeCu-mediated ferroptosis and cuproptosis therapy. In this platform, the MFeCu can catalyze excessive intracellular hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) to generate radical oxygen species (ROS) and deplete glutathione (GSH). The excess of H2O2 and GSH are main factors for radioresistance and chemoresistance, reducing them can enhance chemotherapy and RIT. The generated ROS and depleted GSH further induce mitochondrial dysfunction and promote the aggregation of lipoylated dihydrolipoamide S-acetyltransferase and lipid peroxidation, causing the enhance of ferroptosis and cuproptosis. The in vitro and in vivo results demonstrate that this quadruple-synergistic approach shows significant therapeutic efficacy to complete tumor eradication and reduced recurrence in vivo.

To overcome aggregation induced quenching and diminishment of reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation capability of NIR-PS, aggregation-induced emission (AIE) effect groups have been introduced to generate NIR AIE photosensitizers. However, currently reported NIR AIE photosensitizers all take ""always-on"" activity that may cause systemic phototoxic side effects. Tumor microenvironment activatable NIR AIE photosensitizers have not been reported. Here we develop an activatable NIR AIE PSnanoparticle (a-NA-PSNP) for near-infrared-II (NIR-II) fluorescence (FL) imaging-guided PDT under 808 nm excitation. NIR AIE photosensitizer (N-PS) is designed and frames with cysteine (Cys)/glutathione (GSH) responsive charge transfer complex (CTC) in bovine serum albumin (BSA) to obtain a-NA-PSNP. With the aggregated state in BSA, N-PS shows high quantum yield with good photostability. As an energy acceptor, CTC quenchs NIR-II fluorescence and ROS production capability of a-NA-PSNP in normal cells and tissues. CTC is decomposed in response to tumor microenvironment Cys/GSH, therefore recovers NIR-II fluorescence of a-NA-PSNP and efficiently generates ROS under 808 nm light irradiation. The depletion of Cys/GSH also regulates tumor intracellular reductive environment to further facilitate PDT. Both in vitro and in vivo results confirmed the tumor microenvironment selective and efficient activation of a-NA-PSNP, indicating its potential in cancer therapy.",Biomaterials,2025,downloaded,10.1016/j.biomaterials.2024.122918

However, challenges such as poor stability and premature drug release prior to reaching tumor sites impede the widespread application of this synergistic therapeutic approach. In this study, a novel ATP-responsive NIR fluorescence nanosystem (CDZ) for imaging-guided chemotherapy and PDT has been developed. This nanosystem, based on ZIF-90, encapsulates the chemotherapy drug doxorubicin (DOX) and the photosensitizer asymmetrical cyanine dye Cy through self-assembly. The obtained nanosystem CDZ could efficiently avoid premature drug leakage in the blood circulation due to its high stability in the physiological environment and accumulates at the tumor sites via the enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect. Upon uptake by tumor cells, the skeleton structure of CDZ is disrupted by overexpressed ATP levels, leading to the release of DOX, which inhibits cancer cell proliferation and induces cell death. Additionally, the released photosensitizer Cy emits strong NIR fluorescence signals, enabling real-time imaging of ATP levels in tumors. Moreover, under NIR light irradiation, this nanosystem generates high levels of ROS, achieving effective phototherapy even in deeper tumor regions.

A potential solution lies in combining gas therapy with targeted interventional ablation therapy. In this study, HA-As2S3 nanoparticles with controlled sizes are synthesized using different molecular weights of sodium hyaluronate (HA) as a supramolecular scaffold. Initially, HA co-assembles with arsenic ions (As3+) via coordinate bonds, forming HA-As3+ scaffold intermediates. These intermediates, varying in size, then react with sulfur ions to produce size-controlled HA-As2S3 particles. This approach demonstrates that different molecular weights of HA enable precise control over the particle size of arsenic sulfide, offering a straightforward and environmentally friendly method for synthesizing metal sulfide particles. In an acidic environment, HA-As2S3 nanoparticles release hydrogen sulfide(H2S) gas and As3+. The released As3+ directly damage tumor mitochondria, leading to substantial reactive oxygen species (ROS) production from mitochondria. Concurrently, the H2S gas inhibits the activity of catalase (CAT) and complex IV, preventing the beneficial decomposition of ROS and disrupting electron transfer in the mitochondrial respiratory chain.

While, current immunotherapy is limited by an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME), and ferroptosis is limited by insufficient reactive oxygen species (ROS) and ferroptotic lipids in tumor cells. Here, an arachidonic acid (AA) loaded nanosystem (CTFAP) is developed to mutually reinforce ferroptosis and cancer immunotherapy by augmenting ROS generation and modulating ferroptotic lipids.

However, bioactive ion-induced pyroptosis lacks specificity, and further exploration of other ions that can induce pyroptosis in cancer cells is needed. Sonocatalytic therapy (SCT) holds promise due to its exceptional penetration depth; however, the rapid recombination of electron-hole (e--h+) pairs and the complex tumor microenvironment (TME) impede its broader application. Herein, we discovered that antimony (Sb)-based nanomaterials induced pyroptosis in cancer cells. Therefore, Schottky heterojunctions containing Sb component (Sb2Se3@Pt) were effectively designed and constructed via in situ growth of platinum (Pt) nanoparticles (NPs) on Sb2Se3 semiconductor with narrow band gaps, which were utilized as US-heightened pyroptosis initiators to induce highly effective pyroptosis in cancer cells to boost SCT-immunotherapy. Under US irradiation, excited electrons were transferred from Sb2Se3 nanorods (NRs) to the co-catalyst Pt via Schottky junctions, and band bending effectively prevented electron backflow and achieved efficient ROS generation. Moreover, the pores oxidized and depleted the overexpressed GSH in the TME, potentially amplifying ROS generation. The biological effects of the Sb2Se3@Pt nanoheterojunction itself combined with the sonocatalytic amplification of oxidative stress significantly induced Caspase-1/GSDMD-dependent pyroptosis in cancer cells. Therefore, SCT treatment with Sb2Se3@Pt not only effectively restrained tumor proliferation but also induced potent immune memory responses and suppressed tumor recurrence.

In this study, BiF3@BiOI is synthesized via a co-precipitation method, followed by in-situ reduction to decorate it with Pt nanoparticles, resulting in BiF3@BiOI@Pt-PVP (BBP) nanocomposite for enhancing SDT efficacy. The formation of the BiF3@BiOI heterojunction enhances charge separation ability. The decoration of Pt nanoparticles narrows the bandgap and alters the band positions and Fermi level of BBP, which can effectively mitigate the rapid recombination of electron-hole pairs and facilitate a cascade reaction of ROS, thereby improving ROS generation efficiency with ultrasound excitation. Additionally, bismuth ions in BBP and the generated holes consume glutathione, exacerbating cellular oxidative damage, and triggering PANoptosis and ferroptosis. Furthermore, Pt nanoparticles demonstrate peroxidase-like activity, catalyzing endogenous hydrogen peroxide to oxygen. These functions are helpful against tumors for alleviating hypoxic conditions, reshaping the microenvironment, modulating immune cell infiltration capacity, and enhancing the efficacy of immunotherapy.

The controllable-released TH588 is demonstrated from pores can hinder MTH1-mediated damage-repairing process by preventing the hydrolysis of 8-oxo-dG, thereby amplifying oxidative stress and exacerbating the oxidative DNA damage induced by the sonodynamic therapy of PP@T under ultrasound irradiation. Furthermore, PP@T can effectively induce immunogenic cell death to trigger systemic anti-tumor immune response.

39209877,A singular plasmonic-thermoelectric hollow nanostructure inducing apoptosis and cuproptosis for catalytic cancer therapy.,"Thermoelectric technology has recently emerged as a distinct therapeutic modality. However, its therapeutic effectiveness is significantly limited by the restricted temperature gradient within living organisms. In this study, we introduce a high-performance plasmonic-thermoelectric catalytic therapy utilizing urchin-like Cu2-xSe hollow nanospheres (HNSs) with a cascade of plasmonic photothermal and thermoelectric conversion processes. Under irradiation by a 1064 nm laser, the plasmonic absorption of Cu2-xSe HNSs, featuring rich copper vacancies (VCu), leads to a rapid localized temperature gradient due to their exceptionally high photothermal conversion efficiency (67.0%). This temperature gradient activates thermoelectric catalysis, generating toxic reactive oxygen species (ROS) targeted at cancer cells. Density functional theory calculations reveal that this vacancy-enhanced thermoelectric catalytic effect arises from a much more carrier concentration and higher electrical conductivity. Furthermore, the exceptional photothermal performance of Cu2-xSe HNSs enhances their peroxidase-like and catalase-like activities, resulting in increased ROS production and apoptosis induction in cancer cells. Here we show that the accumulation of copper ions within cancer cells triggers cuproptosis through toxic mitochondrial protein aggregation, creating a synergistic therapeutic effect. Tumor-bearing female BALB/c mice are used to evaluate the high anti-cancer efficiency. This innovative approach represents the promising instance of plasmonic-thermoelectric catalytic therapy, employing dual pathways (membrane potential reduction and thioctylated protein aggregation) of mitochondrial dysfunction, all achieved within a singular nanostructure. These findings hold significant promise for inspiring the development of energy-converting nanomedicines.",Nature communications,2024,downloaded,10.1038/s41467-024-51772-1
39213978,A versatile nanoplatform carrying cascade Pt nanozymes remodeling tumor microenvironment for amplified sonodynamic/chemo therapy of thyroid cancer.,"Thyroid cancer is increasing globally, with anaplastic thyroid carcinoma (ATC) being the most aggressive type and having a poor prognosis. Current clinical treatments for thyroid cancer present numerous challenges, including invasiveness and the necessity of lifelong medication. Furthermore, a significant portion of patients with ATC experience cancer recurrence and metastasis. To overcome this dilemma, we developed a pH-responsive biomimetic nanocarrier (CLP@HP-A) through the incorporation of Chlorin e6 (Ce6) and Lenvatinib (Len) within hollow polydopamine nanoparticles (HP) that were further modified with platinum nanoparticles (Pt), enabling synergistic chemotherapy and sonodynamic therapy. The CLP@HP-A nanocarriers exhibited specific binding with galectin-3 receptors, facilitating their internalization through receptor-mediated endocytosis for targeted drug delivery. Upon exposure to ultrasound (US) irradiation, Ce6 rapidly generated reactive oxygen species (ROS) to induce significant oxidative stress and trigger apoptosis in tumor cells. Additionally, Pt not only alleviated tumor hypoxia by catalyzing the conversion of H2O2 to oxygen (O2) but also augmented intracellular ROS levels through the production of hydroxyl radicals (•OH), thereby enhancing the efficacy of sonodynamic therapy. Moreover, Len demonstrated a potent cytotoxic effect on thyroid cancer cells through the induction of apoptosis. Transcriptomics analysis findings additionally corroborated that CLP@HP-A effectively triggered cancer cell apoptosis, thereby serving as a crucial mechanism for its cytotoxic effects. In conclusion, the integration of sonodynamic/chemo combination therapy with targeted drug delivery systems offers a novel approach to the management of malignant tumors.",Biomaterials,2025,downloaded,10.1016/j.biomaterials.2024.122778

However, there are significant challenges in the in vivo delivery of genes and sonosensitizers during the treatment process, which ultimately affects the therapeutic outcome. In this study, an ultrasound-sensitive targeted liposome nanoparticle system (MLipsiBcl-2) is developed to deliver the sonosensitizers and siRNA for the synergistic treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma. Generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) by MLipsiBcl-2 can be initiated through ultrasound stimulation, leading to liposome rupture and release of the sonosensitizer and small interfering RNA (siRNA). Furthermore, ROS can disrupt lysosomal membranes, facilitating gene release for downregulating overexpressed antiapoptotic protein levels in cancer cells. Experimental results from in vitro and in vivo studies demonstrated the efficacy of synergistic treatment on hepatocellular carcinoma cells and the high biocompatibility of MLipsiBcl-2 under ultrasound stimulation. The advancement of this ultrasound-sensitive targeted gene delivery system shows potential as a versatile therapeutic platform that is easily operable, presenting a prospect for a synergistic treatment approach across various cancer types.","Small (Weinheim an der Bergstrasse, Germany)",2024,downloaded,10.1002/smll.202406182

To achieve localised detection and delivery, gold nanoparticles (AuNP) provide an attractive scaffold to attach multiple luminescent agents on a single particle and provide a multimodal platform for detection and loaclaised delivery. We have developed 13 nm and 25 nm AuNP decorated with an osmium complex based on 1,10-phenantholine and surface active bipyridine ligands, OsPhenSS for live cell imaging and singlet oxygen generation, notated as OsPhenSS·AuNP13 and OsPhenSS·AuNP25. The AuNP designs not only allow versatile modalities for localisation of the probe but also water solubility for the osmium metal complex. The osmium decorated nanoparticles OsPhenSS·AuNP13 and OsPhenSS·AuNP25 display characteristic NIR luminescence from the osmium(II) 3MLCT at 785 nm in aqueous solutions with visible excitation. Upon incubation of the nanoparticles in lung cancer and breast carcinoma the luminescence signature of osmium and the gold reflectance reveal localisation in the cytoplasmic and perinuclear compartments. Excitation of the nanoparticles at 552 nm in the presence of a ROS indicator revealed a marked increase in the green fluorescence from the indicator, consistent with photo-induced ROS generation. The detection of singlet oxygen by time-resolved luminescence studies of the osmium and the nanoparticle probes further demonstrates the dual activity of the osmium-based nanoprobes for imaging and therapy. The introduction of gold nanoparticles for carrying osmium imaging probes allows a novel versatile strategy combining detection and localised therapies at the nanoscale.",Nanoscale,2024,downloaded,10.1039/d4nr01901f
39153721,"An ""Iron-phagy"" nanoparticle inducing irreversible mitochondrial damages for antitumor therapy.","Cellular iron is inseparably related with the proper functionalities of mitochondria for its potential to readily donate and accept electrons. Though promising, the available endeavors of iron chelation antitumor therapies have tended to be adjuvant therapies. Herein, we conceptualized and fabricated an ""iron-phagy"" nanoparticle (Dp44mT@HTH) capable of inducing the absolute devastation of mitochondria via inhibiting the autophagy-removal of impaired ones for promoting cancer cell death. The Dp44mT@HTH with hyaluronic acid (HA) as hydrophilic shell can specifically target the highly expressed CD44 receptors on the surface of 4T1 tumor cells. After internalization and lysosomal escape, the nanoparticle disassembles in response to the reactive oxygen species (ROS), subsequently releasing the iron chelator Dp44mT and autophagy-inhibitory drug hydroxychloroquine (HCQ). Dp44mT can then seize cellular Fe2+ to trigger mitochondrial dysfunction via respiratory chain disturbance, while HCQ not only lessens Fe2+ intake, but also impedes fusions of autophagosomes and lysosomes. Consequentially, Dp44mT@HTH induces irreversible mitochondrial impairments, in this respect creating a substantial toxic stack state that induces apoptosis and cell death. Initiating from the perspective of endogenous substances, this strategy illuminates the promise of iron depletion therapy via irreversible mitochondrial damage induction for anticancer treatment.",Journal of controlled release : official journal of the Controlled Release Society,2024,downloaded,10.1016/j.jconrel.2024.08.024
39098906,A region-confined PROTAC nanoplatform for spatiotemporally tunable protein degradation and enhanced cancer therapy.,"The antitumor performance of PROteolysis-TArgeting Chimeras (PROTACs) is limited by its insufficient tumor specificity and poor pharmacokinetics. These disadvantages are further compounded by tumor heterogeneity, especially the presence of cancer stem-like cells, which drive tumor growth and relapse. Herein, we design a region-confined PROTAC nanoplatform that integrates both reactive oxygen species (ROS)-activatable and hypoxia-responsive PROTAC prodrugs for the precise manipulation of bromodomain and extraterminal protein 4 expression and tumor eradication. These PROTAC nanoparticles selectively accumulate within and penetrate deep into tumors via response to matrix metalloproteinase-2. Photoactivity is then reactivated in response to the acidic intracellular milieu and the PROTAC is discharged due to the ROS generated via photodynamic therapy specifically within the normoxic microenvironment. Moreover, the latent hypoxia-responsive PROTAC prodrug is restored in hypoxic cancer stem-like cells overexpressing nitroreductase. Here, we show the ability of region-confined PROTAC nanoplatform to effectively degrade BRD4 in both normoxic and hypoxic environments, markedly hindering tumor progression in breast and head-neck tumor models.",Nature communications,2024,downloaded,10.1038/s41467-024-50735-w
39068156,Imaging-guided companion diagnostics in radiotherapy by monitoring APE1 activity with afterglow and MRI imaging.,"Companion diagnostics using biomarkers have gained prominence in guiding radiotherapy. However, biopsy-based techniques fail to account for real-time variations in target response and tumor heterogeneity. Herein, we design an activated afterglow/MRI probe as a companion diagnostics tool for dynamically assessing biomarker apurinic/apyrimidinic endonuclease 1(APE1) during radiotherapy in vivo. We employ ultrabright afterglow nanoparticles and ultrasmall FeMnOx nanoparticles as dual contrast agents, significantly broadening signal change range and enhancing the sensitivity of APE1 imaging (limit of detection: 0.0092 U/mL in afterglow imaging and 0.16 U/mL in MRI). We devise longitudinally and transversely subtraction-enhanced imaging (L&T-SEI) strategy to markedly enhance MRI contrast and signal-to-noise ratio between tumor and normal tissue of living female mice. The combined afterglow and MRI facilitate both anatomical and functional imaging of APE1 activity. This probe enables correlation of afterglow and MRI signals with APE1 expression, radiation dosage, intratumor ROS, and DNA damage, enabling early prediction of radiotherapy outcomes (as early as 3 h), significantly preceding tumor size reduction (6 days). By monitoring APE1 levels, this probe allows for early and sensitive detection of liver organ injury, outperforming histopathological analysis. Furthermore, MRI evaluates APE1 expression in radiation-induced abscopal effects provides insights into underlying mechanisms, and supports the development of treatment protocols.",Nature communications,2024,downloaded,10.1038/s41467-024-50688-0
39047871,Stimuli-responsive nanotheranostic systems conjugated with AIEgens for advanced cancer bio-imaging and treatment.,"Aggregation-induced emission (AIE) is a unique phenomenon observed in various materials such as organic luminophores, carbon dots (CDs), organic-inorganic nanocomposites, fluorescent dye molecules, and nanoparticles (NPs). These AIE-active materials, or AIEgens, are ideal for balancing multifunctional phototheranostics and energy dissipation. AIE properties can manifest in organic fluorescent probes, rendering them effective for cancer treatment due to their ability to penetrate deeply and provide high therapeutic efficacy. This efficacy is attributed to their high photobleaching thresholds, ability to induce Stokes shifts, and capacity to activate fluorophores. Therefore, the development of innovative AIE-based materials for disease diagnosis and treatment, particularly for cancer, is both important and promising. Recent years have seen successful demonstrations of nanoparticles with AIE properties being used for photodynamic therapy (PDT) and multimodal imaging of tumor cells. These fluorophores have been shown to impact mitochondria and lysosomes, generate reactive oxygen species (ROS), activate the immune system, load and release drugs, and ultimately induce apoptosis in tumor cells. In this review, we examine previous studies on the manufacturing methods and effects of AIEgens on cancer cells, with a theranostic strategy of simultaneous treatment and imaging.

However, most self-assemblies with non-covalent bonding interactions are susceptible to complex physiological environments, leading to weak stability and loss of biological function. Here, we develop a coupling-induced assembly (CIA) strategy to generate covalently crosslinked nanofibers, which is applied for in situ constructing artificial shell on mitochondria. The oxidation-responsive peptide-porphyrin conjugate P1 is synthesized, which self-assemble into nanoparticles. Under the oxidative microenvironment of mitochondria, the coupling of thiols in P1 causes the formation of dimers, which is further ordered and stacked into crosslinked nanofibers. As a result, the artificial shell is constructed on the mitochondria efficiently through multivalent cooperative interactions due to the increased binding sites. Under ultrasound (US) irradiation, the porphyrin molecules in the shell produce a large amount of reactive oxygen species (ROS) that act on the adjacent mitochondrial membrane, exhibiting ~2-fold higher antitumor activity than nanoparticles in vitro and in vivo. Therefore, the mitochondria-targeted CIA strategy provides a novel perspective on improved sonodynamic therapy (SDT) and shows potential applications in antitumor therapies.",Angewandte Chemie (International ed. in English),2024,downloaded,10.1002/ange.202411725

However, their clinical application remains limited by their high toxicity. Here we show a cell membrane-targeting cationic polymer with antineoplastic activity (Pmt) and a second near-infrared (NIR-II) fluorescent biodegradable polymer with photosensitizer Bodipy units and reactive oxygen species (ROS) responsive thioketal bonds (PBodipy). Subsequently, these two polymers can self-assemble into antineoplastic nanoparticles (denoted mt-NPBodipy) which could further accumulate at the tumor and destroy cell membranes through electrostatic interactions, resulting in cell membrane destabilization. Meanwhile, the photosensitizer Bodipy produces ROS to induce damage to cell membranes, proteins, and DNAs to kill cancer cells concertedly, finally resulting in cell membrane lysis and cancer cell death.

Herein, we develop Au-polyoxometalate-layered double hydroxide (Au-POM-LDH) sub-1 nm nanosheets (Sub-APL) based on the above strategy, where sub-1 nm Au clusters with negative valence are generated by the in situ disintegration of Au nanoparticles on POM-LDH supports. Sub-1 nm Au clusters with ultrahigh surface atom ratios exhibit remarkable efficiency for glutathione (GSH) depletion. The closely connected sub-1 nm Au with negative valence and POM hetero-units can promote the separation of hole-electrons, resulting in the enhanced reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation under ultrasound (US). Besides, the reversible redox of Mo in POM is able to deplete GSH and trigger chemodynamic therapy (CDT) simultaneously, further enhancing the oxidative stress. Consequently, the Sub-APL present 2-fold ROS generation under US and 7-fold GSH depletion compared to the discrete Au and POM-LDH mixture. Therefore, the serious imbalance of redox in the TME caused by the sharp increase of ROS and rapid decrease of GSH leads to death of tumor ultimately.",Angewandte Chemie (International ed. in English),2024,downloaded,10.1002/anie.202410649

Yet, poor tumor penetration of nanodrugs results in limited antitumor efficacy. Herein, an oxygen-driven silicon-based nanomotor (Si-motor) loaded with MnO and CaO2 nanoparticles is developed, which can move in tumor microenvironment (TME) by the cascade reaction of CaO2 and MnO. Under acidic TME, CaO2 reacts with acid to release Ca2+ to induce mitochondrial damage and simultaneously produces O2 and H2O2, when the loaded MnO exerts Fenton-like activity to produce ·OH and O2 based on the produced H2O2. The generated O2 drives Si-motor forward, thus endowing active delivery capability of the formed motors in TME. Meanwhile, MnO with glutathione (GSH) depletion ability further prevents reactive oxygen species (ROS) from being destroyed. Such TME actuated Si-motor with enhanced cellular uptake and deep penetration provides amplification of synergistic oxidative stresscaused by intracellular Ca2 + overloading, GSH depletion induced by Mn2+, and Mn2+ mediated chemodynamic treatment (CDT), leading to excellent tumor cell death.

Therefore, designing a novel sonosensitizer that simultaneously possesses efficient ROS generation and enhanced mechanical effects is promising. In this study, carbon-doped zinc oxide nanoparticles (C-ZnO) are constructed for mechano-sonodynamic cancer therapy. The presence of carbon (C) doping optimizes the electronic structure, thereby enhancing the ROS generation triggered by US, efficiently inducing tumor cell death. On the other hand, the high specific surface area and porous structure brought about by C doping enable C-ZnO to enhance the mechanical stress induced by cavitation bubbles under US irradiation, causing severe mechanical damage to tumor cells. Under the dual effects of sonodynamic therapy (SDT) and mechanical therapy mediated by C-ZnO, excellent anti-tumor efficacy is demonstrated both in vitro and in vivo, along with a high level of biological safety.

38815213,NIR-II Absorption/Emission Dual Function Based 2D Targeted Nanotheranostics for Tunable Hydrogenothermal Therapy.,"Photothermal therapy (PTT) is a promising approach for treating tumors that offers multiple advantages. Nevertheless, its practical use in clinical settings faces several limitations, such as suboptimal delivery efficiency, uneven heat distribution, and challenges in predicting optimal treatment duration. In addition, the localized hyperthermia generated by the PTT method to induce cell apoptosis can result in the production of excessive reactive oxygen species (ROS) and the release of inflammatory cytokines, which can pose a threat to the healthy tissues surrounding the tumor. To address the above challenges, this work designs an integrated H2 delivery nanoplatform for multimodal imaging H2 thermal therapy. The combination of the second near-infrared window (NIR-II) fluorescence imaging (FL) agent (CQ4T) and the photothermal and photoacoustic (PA) properties of Ti3C2 (TC) enables real-time monitoring of the tumor area and guides photothermal treatment. Simultaneously, due to the acid-responsive H2 release characteristics of the nanoplatform, H2 can be utilized for synergistic photothermal therapy to eradicate tumor cells effectively. Significantly, acting as an antioxidant and anti-inflammatory agent, Ti3C2-BSA-CQ4T-H2 (TCBCH) protects peritumoral normal cells from damage.

38813586,Combination of MHI148 Targeted Photodynamic Therapy and STING Activation Inhibits Tumor Metastasis and Recurrence.,"Metastasis and recurrence are notable contributors to mortality associated with breast cancer. Although immunotherapy has shown promise in mitigating these risks after conventional treatments, its effectiveness remains constrained by significant challenges, such as impaired antigen presentation by dendritic cells (DCs) and inadequate T cell infiltration into tumor tissues. To address these limitations, we developed a multifunctional nanoparticle platform, termed GM@P, which consisted of a hydrophobic shell encapsulating the photosensitizer MHI148 and a hydrophilic core containing the STING agonist 2'3'-cGAMP. This design elicited robust type I interferon responses to activate antitumor immunity. The GM@P nanoparticles loaded with MHI148 specifically targeted breast cancer cells. Upon exposure to 808 nm laser irradiation, the MHI148-loaded nanoparticles produced toxic reactive oxygen species (ROS) to eradicate tumor cells through photodynamic therapy (PDT). Notably, PDT stimulated immunogenic cell death (ICD) to foster the potency of antitumor immune responses. Furthermore, the superior photoacoustic imaging (PAI) capabilities of MHI148 enabled the simultaneous visualization of diagnostic and therapeutic procedures. Collectively, our findings uncovered that the combination of PDT and STING activation facilitated a more conducive immune microenvironment, characterized by enhanced DC maturation, infiltration of CD8+ T cells, and proinflammatory cytokine release.

To this end, we proposed a strategy to modulate surface plasmon resonance and endow WO3-x nanoparticles (NPs) with enzyme-like catalytic properties by doping Fe2+ in the structure of the NPs. Doping of the Fe2+ introduced oxygen vacancies into the structure of the NPs, inducing a red shift of the maximum absorption wavelength into the near-infrared II (NIR-II) region and enhancing the photoacoustic (PA) and photothermal properties of the NPs for more effective imaging-guided cancer therapy. Under NIR-II laser irradiation, the Fe-WO3-x NPs produced very strong NIR-II PA and photothermal effects, which significantly enhanced the PA imaging and photothermal treatment effects. On the other hand, Fe2+ in Fe-WO3-x could undergo Fenton reactions with H2O2 in the tumor tissue to generate ·OH for chemodynamic therapy. In addition, Fe-WO3-x can also catalyze the above reactions to produce more reactive oxygen species (ROS) and induce the oxidation of NADH to interfere with intracellular adenosine triphosphate (ATP) synthesis, thereby further improving the efficiency of cancer therapy. Specific imaging of tumor tissue and targeted synergistic therapy was achieved after ligation of a MUC1 aptamer to the surface of the Fe-WO3-x NPs by the complexing of -COOH in MUC1 with tungsten ions on the surface of the NPs. These results demonstrated that Fe-WO3-x NPs could be a promising diagnosis and therapeutic agent for cancer.

However, the complexity of the tumor substantially limits the efficacy of individual stimulus-triggered dynamic therapy. Herein, bimetallic copper and ruthenium (Cu@Ru) core-shell nanoparticles are applied for endo-exogenous stimulation-triggered dynamic therapy. The electronic structure of Cu@Ru is regulated through the ligand effects to improve the adsorption level for small molecules, such as water and oxygen. The core-shell heterojunction interface can rapidly separate electron-hole pairs generated by ultrasound and light stimulation, which initiate reactions with adsorbed small molecules, thus enhancing ROS generation.

However, due to the low stability, potential bio-toxicity and lack of tumor targeting capability of most sonosensitizers, the vast clinical application of SDT has been challenging and limited. Therefore, it is desirable to develop a novel approach to implement sonosensitizers to SDT for cancer treatments. In this study, an amphiphilic polypeptide was designed to effectively encapsulate rose bengal (RB) as a model sonosensitizer to form peptido-nanomicelles (REPNs). The as-fabricated REPNs demonstrated satisfactory tumor targeting and fluorescence performances, which made them superb imaging tracers in vivo.

Herein, it is found that gold nanobipyramid (AuNBs) coated with TiO2 can form a core-shell heterogeneous structure (AuNBs@TiO2) with strong absorption at second near infrared (NIR-II) region. A substantial quantity of reactive oxygen species (ROS), including singlet oxygen (1O2), superoxide anion radicals, and hydroxyl radicals, can be rapidly generated when subjecting the AuNBs@TiO2 aqueous suspension to 1064 nm laser irradiation. The quantum yield for sensitization of 1O2 by AuNBs@TiO2 is 0.36 at 1064 nm light excitation. In addition, the Au element as high-Z atoms in the nanosystem can improve the ability of computed tomographic (CT) imaging. As compared to commercial iohexol, the AuNBs@TiO2 nanoparticle exhibits significantly better CT imaging effect, which can be used to guide PDT.

Herein, a novel nanoplatform, LipoHPM, designed to address these challenges, is reported. This approach employs an acid-sensitive amine linker to connect a biotin-modified hydrophilic polymer (BiotinPEG) with a new hydrophobic photosensitizer (MBA), forming OFF-state BiotinPEG-MBA (PM) micelles via an aggregation-caused quenching (ACQ) effect. These micelles are then co-loaded with the tumor penetration enhancer hydralazine (HDZ) into pH-sensitive liposomes (LipoHPM). Leveraging the ACQ effect, LipoHPM is silent in both fluorescence and reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation during blood circulation but restores both properties upon disassembly. Following intravenous injection in tumor-bearing mice, LipoHPM actively targets tumor cells overexpressing biotin-receptors, contributing to enhanced tumor accumulation. Upon cellular internalization, LipoHPM disassembles within lysosomes, releasing HDZ to enhance tumor penetration and inhibit tumor metastasis. Concurrently, the micelles activate fluorescence for tumor imaging and boost the production of both type-I and type-II ROS for tumor eradication. Therefore, the smart LipoHPM synergistically integrates near-infrared emission, activatable tumor imaging, robust ROS generation, efficient anti-tumor and anti-metastasis activity, successfully overcoming limitations of conventional photosensitizers and establishing itself as a promising nanoplatform for potent FIG-PDT applications.","Advanced materials (Deerfield Beach, Fla.)",2024,downloaded,10.1002/adma.202404296
38685386,Effective glioblastoma immune sonodynamic treatment mediated by macrophage cell membrane cloaked biomimetic nanomedicines.,"Glioblastoma (GBM) as one of the most lethal brain tumours, remains poor therapeutic index due to its typical characters including heterogeneous, severe immune suppression as well as the existence of blood brain barrier (BBB). Immune sonodynamic (ISD) therapy combines noninvasive sonodynamic therapy with immunotherapy, which has great prospects for the combinational treatment of GBM. Herein, we develop macrophage cell membrane cloaked reactive oxygen species (ROS) responsive biomimetic nanoparticles, co-delivering of sonosensitizer Ce6 and JQ1 (a bromo-domain protein 4 (BRD4) inhibitor which can down-regulate PD-L1) and realizing potent GBM ISD therapy.

The ROS responsive polymeric inner core could be readily degraded as triggered by excessive ROS under the ultrasound once they accumulated in tumour cells, fast release encapsulated drugs. The generation of ROS not only killed tumour cells via sonodynamic therapy, but also induced immunogenic cell death (ICD) and further activated the anti-tumour immune response. The released JQ1 inhibited tumour cell proliferation and augmented the immune activities by inhibiting the PD-L1 expression on the surface of tumour cells. The cascade sonodynamic and immune therapy resulted in significantly improved median survival time in both orthotopic GL261 and PTEN deficient immunosuppressive CT2A GBM mice models.

38551448,Monitoring ROS Responsive Fe3O4-based Nanoparticle Mediated Ferroptosis and Immunotherapy via 129Xe MRI.,"The immune checkpoint blockade strategy has improved the survival rate of late-stage lung cancer patients. However, the low immune response rate limits the immunotherapy efficiency. Here, we report a ROS-responsive Fe3O4-based nanoparticle that undergoes charge reversal and disassembly in the tumor microenvironment, enhancing the uptake of Fe3O4 by tumor cells and triggering a more severe ferroptosis. In the tumor microenvironment, the nanoparticle rapidly disassembles and releases the loaded GOx and the immune-activating peptide Tuftsin under overexpressed H2O2. GOx can consume the glucose of tumor cells and generate more H2O2, promoting the disassembly of the nanoparticle and drug release, thereby enhancing the therapeutic effect of ferroptosis. Combined with Tuftsin, it can more effectively reverse the immune-suppressive microenvironment and promote the recruitment of effector T cells in tumor tissues. Ultimately, in combination with α-PD-L1, there is significant inhibition of the growth of lung metastases. Additionally, the hyperpolarized 129Xe method has been used to evaluate the Fe3O4 nanoparticle-mediated immunotherapy, where the ventilation defects in lung metastases have been significantly improved with complete lung structure and function recovered.

38501312,External stimuli-triggered photodynamic and sonodynamic therapies in combination with hybrid nanomicelles of ICG@PEP@HA: laser vs. ultrasound.,"The concept of combining external medical stimuli with internal functional biomaterials to achieve cancer-oriented treatments is being emergingly developed. Optical and acoustical activations have shown particular promise as non-invasive regulation modalities in cancer treatment and intervention. It is always challenging to leverage the contributions of optical and acoustical stimuli and find appropriate biomaterials to optimally match them. Herein, a type of hybrid nanomicelle (ICG@PEP@HA) containing ICG as a photo/sonosensitizer, an amphiphilic peptide for membrane penetration and hyaluronic acid for cluster determinant 44 (CD44) targeting was fabricated. Triggered by the external stimuli of laser and US irradiation, their photo/sonothermal performance, in vitro reactive oxygen species (ROS) production capability and tumor-targeting efficiency have been systematically evaluated. It was interestingly found that the external stimulus of laser irradiation induced a greater quantity of ROS, which resulted in significant cell apoptosis and tumor growth inhibition in the presence of ICG@PEP@HA. The individual analyses and corresponding rationales have been investigated. Meanwhile, these hybrid nanomicelles were administered into MDA-MB-231 tumor-bearing nude mice for PDT and SDT therapies and their biocompatibility assessment, and a prevailing PDT efficacy and reliable bio-safety have been evidenced based on the hematological analysis and histochemical staining. In summary, this study has validated a novel pathway to utilize these hybrid nanomicelles for laser/US-triggered localized tumor treatment, and the treatment efficiency may be leveraged by different external stimuli sources. It is also expected to give rise to full accessibility to clinical translations for human cancer treatments by means of the as-reported laser/US-nanomicelle combination strategy.",Nanoscale,2024,downloaded,10.1039/d4nr00243a
38478044,Coordination Self-Assembled AuTPyP-Cu Metal-Organic Framework Nanosheets with pH/Ultrasound Dual-Responsiveness for Synergistically Triggering Cuproptosis-Augmented Chemotherapy.,"Reactive oxygen species (ROS) mediated tumor cell death is a powerful anticancer strategy. Cuproptosis is a copper-dependent and ROS-mediated prospective tumor therapy strategy. However, the complex tumor microenvironment (TME), low tumor specificity, poor therapy efficiency, and lack of imaging capability impair the therapy output of current cuproptosis drugs. Herein, we designed a dual-responsive two-dimensional metal-organic framework (2D MOF) nanotheranostic via a coordination self-assembly strategy using Au(III) tetra-(4-pyridyl) porphine (AuTPyP) as the ligand and copper ions (Cu2+) as nodes. The dual-stimulus combined with the protonation of the pyridyl group in AuTPyP and deep-penetration ultrasound (US) together triggered the controlled release in an acidic TME. The ultrathin structure (3.0 nm) of nanotheranostics promoted the release process. The released Cu2+ was reduced to Cu+ by depleting the overexpressed glutathione (GSH) in the tumor, which not only activated the Ferredoxin 1 (FDX1)-mediated cuproptosis but also catalyzed the overexpressed hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) in the tumor into reactive oxygen species via Fenton-like reaction. Simultaneously, the released AuTPyP could specifically bind with thioredoxin reductase and activate the redox imbalance of tumor cells. These together selectively induced significant mitochondrial vacuoles and prominent tumor cell death but did not damage the normal cells. The fluorescence and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) results verified this nanotheranostic could target the HeLa tumor to greatly promote the self-enhanced effect of chemotherapy/cuproptosis and tumor inhibition efficiency. The work helped to elucidate the controlled assembly of multiresponsive nanotheranostics and the high-specificity ROS regulation for application in anticancer therapy.",ACS nano,2024,downloaded,10.1021/acsnano.3c13225
38381576,Chemiluminescent Conjugated Polymer Nanoparticles for Deep-Tissue Inflammation Imaging and Photodynamic Therapy of Cancer.,"Deep-tissue optical imaging and photodynamic therapy (PDT) remain a big challenge for the diagnosis and treatment of cancer. Chemiluminescence (CL) has emerged as a promising tool for biological imaging and in vivo therapy. The development of covalent-binding chemiluminescence agents with high stability and high chemiluminescence resonance energy transfer (CRET) efficiency is urgent. Herein, we design and synthesize an unprecedented chemiluminescent conjugated polymer PFV-Luminol, which consists of conjugated polyfluorene vinylene (PFV) main chains and isoluminol-modified side chains. Notably, isoluminol groups with chemiluminescent ability are covalently linked to main chains by amide bonds, which dramatically narrow their distance, greatly improving the CRET efficiency. In the presence of pathologically high levels of various reactive oxygen species (ROS), especially singlet oxygen (1O2), PFV-Luminol emits strong fluorescence and produces more ROS. Furthermore, we construct the PFV-L@PEG-NPs and PFV-L@PEG-FA-NPs nanoparticles by self-assembly of PFV-Luminol and amphiphilic copolymer DSPE-PEG/DSPE-PEG-FA. The chemiluminescent PFV-L@PEG-NPs nanoparticles exhibit excellent capabilities for in vivo imaging in different inflammatory animal models with great tissue penetration and resolution. In addition, PFV-L@PEG-FA-NPs nanoparticles show both sensitive in vivo chemiluminescence imaging and efficient chemiluminescence-mediated PDT for antitumors.

38334437,Tumor Microenvironment-Sensitive Ca2+ Nanomodulator Combined with the Sonodynamic Process for Enhanced Cancer Therapy.,"Tumor therapy presents significant challenges, and conventional treatments exhibit limited therapeutic effectiveness. Imbalance of calcium homeostasis as a key cause of tumor cell death has been extensively studied in tumor therapy. Calcium overload therapy has garnered significant interest as a new cancer treatment strategy. This study involves the synthesis of a transformable nanosonosensitizer with a shell of a calcium ion nanomodulator. The nanosystem is designed to induce mitochondrial dysfunction by combining the calcium ion nanomodulator, nanosonosensitizer, and chemotherapeutic drug. Under ultrasound-activated conditions, CaCO3 dissolves in the tumor microenvironment, causing the nanosonosensitizer to switch from the ""off"" to the ""on"" state of ROS generation, exacerbating mitochondrial calcium overload. A two-dimensional Ti3C2/TiO2 heterostructure generates reactive oxygen species (ROS) under ultrasound and exhibits an efficient sonodynamic effect, enhancing calcium overload. Under ultrasound irradiation, Ti3C2/TiO2@CaCO3/KAE causes multilevel damage to mitochondria by combining the effects of rapid Ca2+ release, inhibiting Ca2+ efflux, enhancing tumor inhibition, and converting a ""cold"" tumor into a ""hot"" tumor. Therefore, this study proposes a method to effectively combine mitochondrial Ca2+ homeostasis and sonodynamic therapy (SDT) by the preparing pH-sensitive, double-activated, and multifunctional Ti3C2/TiO2-based nanosystems for cancer therapy.",ACS applied materials & interfaces,2024,downloaded,10.1021/acsami.3c14865.s001
38319010,A Triple-Responsive Polymeric Prodrug Nanoplatform with Extracellular ROS Consumption and Intracellular H2O2 Self-Generation for Imaging-Guided Tumor Chemo-Ferroptosis-Immunotherapy.,"High reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels in tumor microenvironment (TME) impair both immunogenic cell death (ICD) efficacy and T cell activity. Furthermore, tumor escapes immunosurveillance via programmed death-1/programmed death ligand-1 (PD-L1) signal, and the insufficient intracellular hydrogen peroxide weakens ferroptosis efficacy. To tackle the above issues, a glutathione (GSH)/ROS/pH triple-responsive prodrug nanomedicine that encapsulates Fe2O3 nanoparticle via electrostatic interaction is constructed for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-guided multi-mode theranostics with chemotherapy/ferroptosis/immunotherapy. The diselenide bond consumes ROS in TME to increase T cells and ICD efficacy, the cleavage of which facilitates PD-L1 antagonist D peptide release to block immune checkpoint. After intracellular internalization, Fe2O3 nanoparticle is released in the acidic endosome for MRI simultaneously with lipid peroxides generation for tumor ferroptosis. Doxorubicin is cleaved from polymers in the condition of high intracellular GSH level accompanied by tumor ICD, which simultaneously potentiates ferroptosis by NADPH oxidase mediated H2O2 self-generation. In vivo results indicate that the nanoplatform strengthens tumor ICD, induces cytotoxic T lymphocytes proliferation, inhibits 4T1 tumor regression and metastasis, and prolongs survival median. In all, a new strategy is proposed in strengthening ICD and T cells activity cascade with ferroptosis as well as immune checkpoint blockade for effective tumor immunotherapy.",Advanced healthcare materials,2024,downloaded,10.1002/adhm.202303568
38272398,Nanodrugs mediate TAMs-related arginine metabolism interference to boost photodynamic immunotherapy.,"As a potential treatment strategy for low immunogenic triple negative breast cancer (TNBC), photodynamic therapy (PDT) induced antitumor immunotherapy is greatly limited by the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (ITM), especially the M2 phenotype tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs). The balance of arginine metabolism plays an important role in TAMs polarization. Herein, a multifunctional nanoplatform (defined as HN-HFPA) was employed to burst the anti-tumor immunity of TNBC post PDT by reeducating TAMs through interfering the TAMs-associated arginine metabolism. The L-arginine (L-Arg) was loaded in the hollow cavity of HN-HFPA, which could not only generate nitric oxide (NO) for tumor therapy, but also serve as a substrate of arginine metabolism pathway. As an inhibitor of arginases-1 (Arg-1) of M2 TAMs, L-norvaline (L-Nor) was modified to the hyaluronic acid (HA), and coated in the surface of HFPA. After degradation of HA by hyaluronidase in tumor tissue and GSH-mediated disintegration, HN-HFPA depleted intracellular GSH, produced remarkable reactive oxygen species (ROS) under light irradiation and released L-Arg to generate NO, which induced tumor immunogenic cell death (ICD). Real-time ultrasound imaging of tumor was realized taking advantage of the gas feature of NO. The L-Nor suppressed the Arg-1 overexpressed in M2, which skewed the balance of arginine metabolism and reversed the ITM with increased ratios of M1 and CD8+ T cells, finally resulted in amplified antitumor immune response and apparent tumor metastasis inhibition. This study remodeled ITM to strengthen immune response post PDT, which provided a promising treatment strategy for TNBC.",Journal of controlled release : official journal of the Controlled Release Society,2024,downloaded,10.1016/j.jconrel.2024.01.045
38225710,An Ultrasound-Triggered STING Pathway Nanoagonist for Enhanced Chemotherapy-Induced Immunogenic Cell Death.,"Although chemotherapy has the potential to induce tumor immunotherapy via immunogenic cell death (ICD) effects, how to control the intensity of the immune responses still deserves further exploration. Herein, a controllable ultrasound (US)-triggered chemo-immunotherapy nanoagonist is successfully synthesized by utilizing the pH and reactive oxygen species (ROS) dual-responsive PEG-polyphenol to assemble sonosensitizer zinc oxide (ZnO) and doxorubicin (DOX). The PZnO@DOX nanoparticles have an intelligent disassembly to release DOX and zinc ions in acidic pH conditions. Notably, US irradiation generates ROS by sonodynamic therapy and accelerates the drug release process. Interestingly, after the PZnO@DOX+US treatment, the injured cells release double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) from the nucleus and mitochondria into the cytosol. Subsequently, both the dsDNA and zinc ions bind with cyclic GMP-AMP synthase and activate the stimulator of interferon genes (STING) pathway, resulting in the dendritic cell maturation, ultimately promoting DOX-induced ICD effects and antigen-specific T cell immunity. Therefore, chemotherapy-induced immune responses can be modulated by non-invasive control of US.","Small (Weinheim an der Bergstrasse, Germany)",2024,downloaded,10.1002/smll.202309850
38196070,Synergistic Glutathione Depletion and STING Activation to Potentiate Dendritic Cell Maturation and Cancer Vaccine Efficacy.,"Dendritic cell (DC) maturation and antigen presentation are key factors for successful vaccine-based cancer immunotherapy. This study developed manganese-based layered double hydroxide (Mn-LDH) nanoparticles as a self-adjuvanted vaccine carrier that not only promoted DC maturation through synergistically depleting endogenous glutathione (GSH) and activating STING signaling pathway, but also facilitated the delivery of model antigen ovalbumin (OVA) into lymph nodes and subsequent antigen presentation in DCs. Significant therapeutic-prophylactic efficacy of the OVA-loaded Mn-LDH (OVA/Mn-LDH) nanovaccine was determined by the tumor growth inhibition in the mice bearing B16-OVA tumor. Our results showed that the OVA/Mn-LDH nanoparticles could be a potent delivery system for cancer vaccine development without the need of adjuvant.

38087964,A NIR-driven green affording-oxygen microrobot for targeted photodynamic therapy of tumors.,"Photodynamic therapy (PDT) is a light-activated local treatment modality that has promising potential in cancer therapy. However, ineffective delivery of photosensitizers and hypoxia in the tumor microenvironment severely restrict the therapeutic efficacy of PDT. Herein, phototactic Chlorella (C) is utilized to carry photosensitizer-encapsulated nanoparticles to develop a near-infrared (NIR) driven green affording-oxygen microrobot system (CurNPs-C) for enhanced PDT. Photosensitizer (curcumin, Cur) loaded nanoparticles are first synthesized and then covalently attached to C through amide bonds. An in vitro study demonstrates that the developed CurNPs-C exhibits continuous oxygen generation and desirable phototaxis under NIR treatment. After intravenous injection, the initial 660 nm laser irradiation successfully induces the active migration of CurNPs-C to tumor sites for higher accumulation. Upon the second 660 nm laser treatment, CurNPs-C produces abundant oxygen, which in turn induces the natural product Cur to generate more reactive oxygen species (ROS) that significantly inhibit the growth of tumors in 4T1 tumor-bearing mice. This contribution showcases the ability of a light-driven green affording-oxygen microrobot to exhibit targeting capacity and O2 generation for enhancing photodynamic therapy.",Nanoscale,2024,downloaded,10.1039/d3nr03801g

However, it is highly significant to develop safe and efficient radiosensitizing agents for tumor radiation therapy. Herein, we present a smart nanotheranostic system FA-Au-CH that consists of gold nanoradiosensitizers, photosensitizer chlorin e6 (Ce6), and folic acid (FA) as a folate-receptor-targeting ligand for improved tumor specificity. FA-Au-CH nanoparticles have been demonstrated to be able to simultaneously serve as radiosensitizers and RDT agents for enhanced computed tomography (CT) imaging-guided radiotherapy (RT) of colon carcinoma, owing to the strong X-ray attenuation capability of high-Z elements Au and Hf, as well as the characteristics of Hf that can transfer radiation energy to Ce6 to generate ROS from Ce6 under X-ray irradiation.

37943281,Functionalized Fe-Doped Carbon Dots Exhibiting Dual Glutathione Consumption to Amplify Ferroptosis for Enhanced Cancer Therapy.,"Nonapoptotic ferroptosis is a promising cancer treatment which offers a solution to the multidrug resistance of conventional apoptosis-induced programmed cancer cell death therapies. Reducing intracellular glutathione (GSH) is essential for inducing excess ROS and has been considered a crucial process to trigger ferroptosis. However, treatments reducing GSH alone have not produced satisfactory effects due to their restricted target. In this regard, FeCDs (Fe3+-modified l-histidine -sourced carbon dots) with dual GSH-consumption capabilities were constructed to engineer ferroptosis by self-amplifying intratumoral oxidative stress. Carbon dots have the ability to consume GSH, and the introduction of Fe3+ can amplify the GSH-consuming ability of CDs, reacting with excess H2O2 in the tumor microenvironment to generate highly oxidized •OH. This is a novel strategy through synergistic self-amplification therapy combining Fe3+ and CDs with GSH-consuming activity. The acid-triggered degradation material (FeCDs@PAE-PEG) was prepared by encapsulating FeCDs in an oil-in-water manner. Compared with other ferroptosis-triggering nanoparticles, the established FeCDs@PAE-PEG is targeted and significantly enhances the consumption efficiency of GSH and accumulation of excess iron without the involvement of infrared light and ultrasound. This synergistic strategy exhibits excellent ferroptosis-inducing ability and antitumor efficacy both in vitro and in vivo and offers great potential for clinical translation of ferroptosis.",ACS applied materials & interfaces,2023,downloaded,10.1021/acsami.3c12356
37939375,Ultrathin Clay Nanoparticles-Mediated Mutual Reinforcement of Ferroptosis and Cancer Immunotherapy.,"Ferroptosis-triggered immunogenic cell death (ICD) is widely adopted to potentiate the body's antitumor immunity by catalyzing the production of toxic reactive oxygen species (ROS). However, the efficacy of ferroptosis and immunotherapy is greatly restricted by intracellular abundant glutathione (GSH) and immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME). Herein, a facile bottom-up method for solvent-free synthesis of ultrathin manganese (Mn)-based layered double hydroxide nanosheets with high loading efficiency for pro-inflammatory cytokine interferon (IFNγ) (IFNγ/uMn-LDHs) is proposed to mutually reinforce the ferroptosis and systemic immunity. The introduction of manganese ions significantly contributes to GSH depletion and hydroxyl radical generation, which can be further enhanced by IFNγ delivery-induced SLC7A11 downregulation. The ICD effect after cell ferroptosis cooperates with the intrinsic immunomodulatory property of IFNγ/uMn-LDHs to facilitate the maturation of dendritic cells (DCs) and the priming of T cells. IFNγ secretion from activated CD8+ T cells in turn involves cascade immunogenic ferroptosis, thus constructing a closed-loop therapy. Remarkably, a potent abscopal effect is observed in the growth inhibition of both primary and distant tumors. Overall, the ultrathin Mn-based clay nanoplatform provides a simple approach for mutual regulation between ferroptosis and antitumor immune response, overcoming the obstacles of current cancer immunotherapy.","Advanced materials (Deerfield Beach, Fla.)",2024,downloaded,10.1002/adma.202309562
37856705,Oxygen-Independent Synchronized ROS Generation and Hypoxia Prodrug Activation with Z-Scheme Heterostructure Sonosensitizer.,"Combination therapy has emerged as a promising approach for effective tumor treatment. However, the combination of sonodynamic therapy (SDT) and hypoxia-activated prodrugs (HAPs) has not been explored due to the contradictory requirement of oxygen (O2 ) for reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation and the necessity to avoid O2 for the activation of HAPs. In this study, this challenge is addressed by developing BiOCl-Au-Ag2 S Z-scheme heterostructure nanoparticles loaded with tirapazamine (TPZ) to achieve O2 -independent therapy. These nanoparticles demonstrate efficient electron-hole separation under ultrasound irradiation while maintaining a high redox potential. The generated holes react with water to efficiently produce hydroxyl radicals, while the electrons autonomously activate TPZ, negating the need for O2 . In vitro and in vivo assessments validate the effective tumor elimination by these Z-scheme nanoparticles without disrupting the hypoxic environment. This innovative design overcomes the limitations associated with O2 requirement in SDT and introduces a novel strategy for HAP activation and synergistic therapy between ROS and HAPs-based therapy.","Advanced materials (Deerfield Beach, Fla.)",2024,downloaded,10.1002/adma.202307929
37805936,Porous Molybdenum Nitride Nanosphere as Carrier-Free and Efficient Nitric Oxide Donor for Synergistic Nitric Oxide and Chemo/Sonodynamic Therapy.,"Given its abundant physiological functions, nitric oxide (NO) has attracted much attention as a cancer therapy. The sensitive release and great supply capacity are significant indicators of NO donors and their performance. Here, a transition metal nitride (TMN) MoN@PEG is adopted as an efficient NO donor. The release process starts with H+-triggered denitrogen owing to the high electronegativity of the N atom and weak Mo-N bond. Then, these active NHx are oxidized by O2 and other reactive oxygen species (ROS) to form NO, endowing specific release to the tumor microenvironment (TME). With a porous nanosphere structure (80 nm), MoN@PEG does not require an extra carrier for NO delivery, contributing to ultrahigh atomic utilization for outstanding release ability (94.1 ± 5.6 μM). In addition, it can also serve as a peroxidase and sonosensitizer for anticancer treatment. To further improve the charge separation, MoN-Pt@PEG was prepared to enhance the sonodynamic therapy (SDT) effect. Accordingly, ultrasound (US) further promotes NO generation due to more ROS generation, facilitating in situ peroxynitrite (·ONOO-) generation with great cytotoxicity. At the same time, the nanostructure also degrades gradually, leading to high elimination (94.6%) via feces and urine within 14-day. The synergistic NO and chemo-/sono-dynamic therapy brings prominent antitumor efficiency and further activates the immune response to inhibit metastasis and recurrence.

Optimizing ROS production is a primary objective for enhancing treatment efficiency. In this study, oxygen-vacancy-rich Pd-integrated black barium titanate (BTO) nanoparticles are rationally engineered to boost the ROS generation efficiency via the introduction of Pd. Pd-catalyzed hydrogenation at low temperatures narrows the bandgap of BTO and reduces the recombination rate of electron-hole pairs. Furthermore, Pd has dual-enzyme-mimicking characteristics, including peroxidase- and catalase-mimicking activities, which further heighten the therapeutic efficacy by enhancing ROS production and reversing the hypoxic tumor microenvironment. Importantly, the dual enzymatic activity of Pd can be amplified by multiple redox processes sparked by the piezoelectric potential under US stimulation, resulting in bilaterally enhanced multienzyme-piezoelectric synergetic therapy.

Typically, cystamine (CA) is conjugated onto the end of poly(2-methylthio-ethanol methacrylate) (PMEMA) to generate PMEMA-CA. The PMEMA-CA is grafted onto the surface of brequinar (BQR)-loaded IO to form IO-BQR@PMEMA. The self-assembled IO-BQR@PMEMA (SA-IO-BQR@PMEMA) is obtained due to the hydrophobicity of PMEMA. The carbon-sulfur single bond of PMEMA-CA can be oxidized by reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the TME to a thio-oxygen double bond, resulting in the conversion from being hydrophobic to hydrophilic. The disulfide bond of PMEMA-CA can be broken by the glutathione (GSH) in the TME, leading to the shedding of PMEMA from the IO surface. Under the dual actions of ROS and GSH in TME (i.e., AND logic gate), SA-IO-BQR@PMEMA can be disassembled to release IO, Fe2+/3+ , and BQR. In vitro and in vivo results demonstrate the AND logic gate function and mechanism, the high T1 MRI performance and exceptional ferroptosis therapy efficacy for tumors, and the excellent biosafety of SA-IO-BQR@PMEMA.","Advanced materials (Deerfield Beach, Fla.)",2023,downloaded,10.1002/adma.202305932

In this work, the sonodynamic efficiency of sono-responsive hybrid nanomaterials composed of amorphous titanium dioxide and an amphiphilic poly(ethylene oxide)-b-poly(propylene oxide) block copolymer is synthesized, fully characterized, and investigated both in vitro and in vivo. The modular and versatile synthetic pathway enables the control of the nanoparticle size between 30 and 300 nm (dynamic light scattering) and glucosylation of the surface for active targeting of tumors overexpressing glucose transporters.

However, current photosensitizers are encumbered by limitations such as suboptimal tumor targeting, aggregation-caused quenching (ACQ), and restricted excitation and emission wavelengths. Here, this work designs novel nanoparticles based on aggregation-induced emission (AIE) photosensitizer (BODTPE) for targeted tumor therapy and near-infrared II fluorescence imaging (NIR-II FLI) with enhanced PDT/PTT effects. BODTPE is employed as a monomer, dibenzocyclooctyne (DBCO)-PEG2k -amine serving as an end-capping polymer, to synthesize a BODTPE-containing polymer (DBD). Further, through self-assembly, DBD and mPEG-DSPE2k combined to form nanoparticles (NP-DBD). Notably, the DBCO on the surface of NP-DBD can react with azide groups on cancer cells pretreated with Ac4 ManNAz through a copper-free click reaction. This innovative formulation led to targeted accumulation of NP-DBD within tumor sites, a phenomenon convincingly demonstrated in murine tumor models subjected to N-azidoacetylmannosamine-tetraacylated (Ac4 ManNAz) pretreatment. Significantly, NP-DBD exhibits a multifaceted effect encompassing PDT/PTT/NIR-II FLI upon 808 nm laser irradiation, thereby better activating the cGAS-STING pathway, culminating in a compelling tumor inhibition effect augmented by robust immune modulation.","Advanced materials (Deerfield Beach, Fla.)",2023,downloaded,10.1002/adma.202305668

The efficacy of tumor ferroptosis therapy is always limited by the elimination of lipid peroxides (LPO) by the pathways of glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4), dihydroorotate dehydrogenase (DHODH) and ferroptosis suppressor protein 1(FSP1). To solve these problems, in this study, we developed a STING pathway-activatable contrast agent (i.e., FeGd-HN@TA-Fe2+-SN38 nanoparticles) for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-guided tumor immunoferroptosis synergistic therapy. The remarkable in vivo MRI performance of FeGd-HN@TA-Fe2+-SN38 is attributed to its high accumulation at tumor location, the high relaxivities of FeGd-HN core, and the pH-sensitive TA-Fe2+-SN38 layer. The effectiveness and biosafety of the immunoferroptosis synergistic therapy induced by FeGd-HN@TA-Fe2+-SN38 are demonstrated by the in vivo investigations on the 4T1 tumor-bearing mice. The mechanisms of in vivo immunoferroptosis synergistic therapy by FeGd-HN@TA-Fe2+-SN38 are demonstrated by measurements of in vivo ROS, LPO, GPX4 and SLC7A11 levels, the intratumor matured DCs and CD8+ T cells, the protein expresion of STING and IRF-3, and the secretion of IFN-β and IFN-γ.",Biomaterials,2023,downloaded,10.1016/j.biomaterials.2023.122300

37531495,ROS-Responsive Fluorescent Sensor Array for Precise Diagnosis of Cancer via pH-Controlled Multicolor Gold Nanoclusters.,"Intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) are closely associated with cancer cell types. Therefore, ROS-based pattern recognition is a promising strategy for precise diagnosis of cancer, but such a possibility has never been reported yet. Herein, we proposed an ROS-responsive fluorescent sensor array based on pH-controlled histidine-templated gold nanoclusters (AuNCs@His) to distinguish cancer cell types and their proliferation states. In this strategy, three types of AuNCs@His with diverse fluorescence profiles were first synthesized by only adjusting the pH value. Upon the addition of various ROS, fluorescence quenching of three types of AuNCs@His occurred with different degrees, thereby forming unique optical ""fingerprints"", which were well-clustered into several separated groups without overlap by principal component analysis (PCA). The sensing mechanism was attributable to the oxidation of AuNCs@His by ROS, as revealed by X-ray photoemission spectroscopy, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, 1H nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, and electrospray ionization mass spectrometry. Based on the ROS-responsive sensing pattern, cancer cell types were successfully differentiated via PCA with 100% accuracy. Additionally, the proposed sensor array exhibited excellent performance in distinguishing the proliferation states of cancer cells, which was supported by the results of the Ki-67 immunohistochemistry assay. Overall, the ROS-responsive fluorescent sensor array can serve as a promising tool for precise diagnosis of cancer, indicating great potential for clinical application.",ACS applied materials & interfaces,2023,downloaded,10.1021/acsami.3c09320.s001
37489377,A New Strategy to Elevate Absorptivity of AIEgens for Intensified NIR-II Emission and Synergized Multimodality Therapy.,"High-efficiency absorptivity is crucial for the construction of high-performance luminescent materials, especially the long-wavelength near-infrared II (NIR-II) materials; thus seeking an efficient and universal strategy to elevate the absorptivity is extremely important but is still an intractable challenge. In this work, a simple but efficient design strategy is discovered, involving the introduction of gold(I) unit that could effectively elevate the absorptivity of aggregation-induced-emission luminogens (AIEgens). As a result of the efficient elevation of absorptivity, the representative AIE-active TBTP-Au shows more superior NIR-II (1220 nm) luminescence, much higher photothermal conversion efficiency, and unique intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) generating ability compared with that of the TBTP ligand. Taking advantage of these improvements, the fabricated tumor-targeting TBTP-Au-cRGD nanoparticles achieve specific NIR-II tumorous imaging in vivo and exert high-efficiency cancer therapy via the synergistic chemotherapy and photothermal therapy. Thus, this work provides a new and efficient strategy to construct high-absorption luminescent materials and demonstrates the great potential of gold(I)-based AIEgens as multifunctional theranostic agents.","Advanced materials (Deerfield Beach, Fla.)",2023,downloaded,10.1002/adma.202306616

The interplay between organic polymers and inorganic nanoparticles in novel nanocomposites has proven to be advantageous, overcoming previous limitations and harnessing their full potential through activation via the tumor microenvironment. This study successfully fabricated hypoxia-activated nanocolloids called HOISNDs through a process of self-assembly involving superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (SPIONs) and an organic polymer ligand called tetrakis(4-carboxyphenyl) porphyrin (TCPP)-engineered organic polymer ligand [methoxy poly(ethyleneglycol)-block-poly(dopamine-ethylenediamine-conjugated-4-nitrobenzyl chloroformate)-l-glutamate, mPEG-b-P(Dopa-EDA-co-NBCF)LG-TCPP)]. The SPIONs act as an oxygen generator to overcome the challenges posed by hypoxic tumors and enable the use of hypoxic-activatable MR/fluorescence dual-modal imaging-guided photodynamic therapy (PDT). The colloid stability of these HOISNDs proved to be exceptional in diverse biomimetic environments. Furthermore, they not only augment T2-weighted contrast capability as an MRI contrast agent but also function as an oxygen-producing device to amplify the generation and release of reactive oxygen species (ROS). The HOISNDs can significantly target to tumor sites through the enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect with prolonged blood circulation time and subsequently are effectively endocytosed into a hypoxic intracellular environment that ""turn on"" the imaging function and photodynamic activity. Moreover, HOISNDs possess the ability to effectively decompose naturally occurring H2O2 into oxygen (O2) within the tumor utilizing the Fenton reaction. This method can mitigate the impact of hypoxia on oxygen-dependent PDT. The outcomes of in vivo diagnostic and therapeutic evaluations indicated that HOISNDs are a highly promising tool for dual-model imaging-guided cancer theranosis by ameliorating hypoxic conditions and augmenting PDT efficiency.",ACS applied materials & interfaces,2023,downloaded,10.1021/acsami.3c07008.s001

Despite high effectiveness, it faces limitations like low reaction efficiency and limited endogenous H2 O2 , compromising its therapeutic efficacy. This study reports a novel platform with enhanced CDT performance by in situ sono-activated cascade Fenton reaction. A piezoelectric g-C3 N4 (Au-Fe-g-C3 N4 ) nanosheet is developed via sono-activated synergistic effect/H2 O2 self-supply mediated cascade Fenton reaction, realizing in situ ultrasound activated cascade Fenton reaction kinetics by synergistic modulation of electron-hole separation. The nanosheets consist of piezoelectric g-C3 N4 nanosheet oxidizing H2 O to highly reactive H2 O2 from the valence band, Fe3+ /Fe2+ cycling activated by conduction band to generate ·OH, and Au nanoparticles that lower the bandgap and further adopt electrons to generate more 1 O2 , resulting in improved CDT and sonodynamic therapy (SDT). Moreover, the Au-Fe-g-C3 N4 nanosheet is further modified by the targeted peptide to obtain P-Au-Fe-g-C3 N4 , which inhibits tumor growth in vivo effectively by generating reactive oxygen species (ROS). These results demonstrated that the sono-activated modulation translates into a high-efficiency CDT with a synergistic effect using SDT for improved anti-tumor therapy.",Advanced healthcare materials,2023,downloaded,10.1002/adhm.202300982

Herein, PtMo-Au metalloenzyme sonosensitizer is synthesized by modulating energy band structure of PtMo with Au nanoparticles. The surface deposition of Au simultaneously solves the carrier recombination and facilitates the separation of electrons (e- ) and holes (h+ ), effectively improving the reactive oxygen species (ROS) quantum yield under ultrasound (US). The catalase-like activity of PtMo-Au metalloenzymes alleviates hypoxia TME, thus enhancing the SDT-induced ROS generation. More importantly, tumor overexpressed glutathione (GSH) can serve as the hole scavenger, which is accompanied by a persistent depletion of the GSH, thus inactivating GPX4 for the accumulation of lipid peroxides. The distinctly facilitated SDT-induced ROS production is coupled with chemodynamic therapy (CDT)-induced hydroxyl radicals (•OH) to exacerbate ferroptosis. Furthermore, Au with glucose oxidase mimic activity can not only inhibit intracellular adenosine triphosphate (ATP) production and induce tumor cell starvation but also generate H2 O2 to facilitate CDT. In general, this PtMo-Au metalloenzyme sonosensitizer optimizes the defects of conventional sonosensitizers through surface deposition of Au to regulate TME, providing a novel perspective for US-based tumor multimodal therapy.","Small (Weinheim an der Bergstrasse, Germany)",2023,downloaded,10.1002/smll.202303365

However, the drawbacks of poor water solubility, short emission wavelength, poor stability, and inability to distinguish cancer cells from normal cells limit the application of most type I PSs in clinical therapy. Thereby, developing novel type I PSs for overcoming these problems is an urgent but challenging task. Herein, by utilizing the distinctive structural characteristics of anion-π+ interactions, a highly water-soluble type I PS (DPBC-Br) with aggregation-induced emission (AIE) characteristic and near-infrared (NIR) emission is fabricated for the first time. DPBC-Br displays remarkable water solubility (7.3 mM) and outstanding photobleaching resistance, enabling efficient and precise differentiation between tumor cells and normal cells in a wash-free and long-term tracking manner via NIR-I imaging. Additionally, the superior type I reactive oxygen species (ROS) produced by DPBC-Br provide both specific killing of cancer cells in vitro and inhibition of tumor growth in vivo, with negligible systemic toxicity. This study rationally constructs a highly water-soluble type I PS, which has higher reliability and controllability compared with conventional nanoparticle formulating procedures, offering great potential for clinical cancer treatment.",Angewandte Chemie (International ed. in English),2023,downloaded,10.1002/ange.202307776

However, the therapeutic efficacy of noninvasive SDT is severely limited because the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) by sonosensitizers is highly dependent on the levels of intracellular excess glutathione (GSH) in the tumor cells. To overcome this barrier, a red blood cell (RBC) membrane-camouflaged nanomedicine consisting of GSH-sensitive polyphosphoester (SS-PPE) and ROS-sensitive polyphosphoester (S-PPE) was designed for the simultaneous delivery of the sonosensitizer hematoporphyrin (HMME) and chemotherapeutic agent docetaxel (DTXL) for effectively enhanced antitumor efficacy. In vitro and in vivo studies demonstrated that HMME-driven ROS generation under ultrasound (US) inhibited SCC7 cell proliferation and accelerated DTXL release to further kill tumor cells via the hydrophobic-hydrophilic transition of the nanoparticle core. Meanwhile, the disulfide bond of SS-PPE effectively consumes GSH to prevent ROS consumption.

Fusobacterium nucleatum, a core pathogen of colorectal cancer (CRC), is an important cause of low therapeutic efficacy and metastasis. Thus, the modulation of intratumoral pathogens may provide a target for cancer therapy and metastasis inhibition. Herein, we propose an intratumoral F. nucleatum-modulating strategy for enhancing the therapeutic efficacy of CRC and inhibiting lung metastasis by designing an antibacterial nanoplatform (Au@BSA-CuPpIX), which produced reactive oxygen species (ROS) under ultrasound and exhibited strong antibacterial activity. Importantly, Au@BSA-CuPpIX reduced the levels of apoptosis-inhibiting proteins by inhibiting intratumoral F. nucleatum, thereby enhancing ROS-induced apoptosis. In vivo results demonstrated that Au@BSA-CuPpIX effectively eliminated F. nucleatum to enhance the therapeutic efficacy of sonodynamic therapy (SDT) for orthotopic CRC and inhibit lung metastasis. Notably, entrapped gold nanoparticles reduced the phototoxicity of metalloporphyrin accumulated in the skin during tumor treatment, preventing severe inflammation and damage to the skin. Therefore, this study proposes a strategy for the elimination of F. nucleatum in CRC to enhance the therapeutic effect of SDT, thus providing a promising paradigm for improving cancer treatment with fewer toxic side effects and promoting the clinical translational potential of SDT.",ACS nano,2023,downloaded,10.1021/acsnano.3c01308.s001

Piezoelectric materials, which are capable of generating a built-in electric field under ultrasound (US), not only improve the activity of nanozymes but also enable piezoelectric sonodynamic therapy (SDT). In this study, a sonosensitizer based on a Hf-based metal-organic framework (UIO-66) and Au nanoparticles (NPs) was produced. Under US irradiation, UIO-66 can generate a built-in electric field inside the materials, which promotes electron-hole separation and produces reactive oxygen species (ROS). The introduction of Au NPs facilitated the electron transfer, which inhibited the recombination of the electron-hole pairs and improved the piezoelectric properties of UIO-66. The value of the piezoelectric constant (d33) increased from 71 to 122 pmV-1 after the deposition of Au NPs. In addition, the intrinsic catalase and peroxidase activities of the Au NPs were increased 2-fold after the stimulation from the built-in electric field induced through US exposure. In vivo and in vitro experiments revealed that the proposed sonosensitizer can kill cancer cells and inhibit tumor growth in mice through the enhanced piezoelectric SDT and nanozyme catalytic therapy.

However, precisely targeted therapy is still a huge challenge. Herein, a mitochondrial-targeting phototheranostic system, FE-T nanoparticles (FE-T NPs) are developed to damage mitochondria in tumor cells and change the tumor immunosuppressive microenvironment. FE-T NPs are engineered by encapsulating the near-infrared (NIR) absorbed photosensitizer IR-FE-TPP within amphiphilic copolymer DSPE-SS-PEG-COOH for high-performing with simultaneous mitochondrial-targeting, near-infrared II (NIR-II) fluorescence imaging, and synchronous photothermal therapy (PTT) /photodynamic therapy (PDT) /immune therapy (IMT). In tumor treatment, the disulfide in the copolymer can be cleaved by excess intracellular glutathione (GSH) to release IR-FE-TPP and accumulate in mitochondria. After 808 nm irradiation, the mitochondrial localization of FE-T NPs generated reactive oxygen species (ROS), and hyperthermia, leading to mitochondrial dysfunction, photoinductive apoptosis, and immunogenic cell death (ICD). Notably, in situ enhanced PDT/PTT in vivo via mitochondrial-targeting with FE-T NPs boosts highly efficient ICD toward excellent antitumor immune response.

The natural small molecule Rhein (Rh) was encapsulated into RP-NPs as a sonosensitizer highly accumulated at the tumor site. Then highly tissue-permeable ultrasound (US) irradiation induced apoptosis of tumor cells through the excitation of Rh and acoustic cavitation, which prompted the rapid production of large amounts of ROS in the hypoxic tumor microenvironment. In addition, the thioketal bond structures in the innovatively designed prodrug LA-GEM were triggered and broken by ROS to achieve rapid targeted release of the gemcitabine (GEM). Sonodynamic therapy (SDT) increased the tissue permeability of solid tumors and actively disrupted redox homeostasis via mitochondrial pathways to kill hypoxic tumor cells, and the triggered response mechanism to GEM synergistically amplified the effect of chemotherapy.

Herein, a novel nanoplatform for efficiently triggering NO production based on ultrasound-induced piezocatalysis was developed, which was fabricated by coating amphiphilic poly-l-arginine (DSPE-PEG2000-Arg, DPA) on the piezoelectric material of barium titanate (BTO). The resulting BTO@DPA nanoparticles can efficiently generate H2O2, 1O2, and O2 via ultrasound-induced piezocatalysis based on BTO and oxidize the surface arginine to produce NO, which can even further interact with the reactive oxygen species (ROS) to produce more reactive peroxynitrite, thus inducing serious tumor cell apoptosis both in hypoxia and normoxia. After intravenous injection, BTO@DPA accumulated well at the tumor tissue at 4 h postinjection; later, ultrasound irradiation on the tumor not only achieved the best tumor inhibition rate of ∼70% but also completely inhibited tumor metastasis to the lungs via the alleviation of tumor hypoxia.

Considerable NO nanogenerators and NO releasing molecules have been developed to shield the systemic toxicity caused by free diffusion of NO gas. However, on-demand controlled release of NO and chemotherapy drugs at tumor sites remains a problem limited by the complex and dynamic tumor microenvironment. Herein, we present an ultrasound-responsive nanoprodrug of CPT-t-R-PEG2000@BaTiO3 (CRB) which encapsulates piezoelectric nanomaterials barium titanate nanoparticle (BaTiO3) with amphiphilic prodrug molecules that consisted of thioketal bond (t) linked chemotherapy drug camptothecin (CPT) and NO-donor l-arginine (R). Based on ultrasound-triggered piezocatalysis, BaTiO3 can continuously generate ROS in the hypoxic tumor environment, which induces a cascade of reaction processes to break the thioketal bond to release CPT and oxidize R to release NO, simultaneously delivering CPT and NO to the tumor site. It is revealed that CRB shows a uniform size distribution, prolonged blood circulation time, and excellent tumor targeting ability. Moreover, controlled release of CPT and NO were observed both in vitro and in vivo under the stimulation of ultrasound, which is beneficial to the depletion of dense stroma and subsequently enhanced delivery and efficacy of CPT.

The suppressive tumor associated macrophages(TAMs) and CD47 over-expression greatly lead to the treatment failure. Sonodynamic therapy (SDT) can generate ROS with deep tumor penetration to induce tumor cell apoptosis, which is reported to further induce M1 macrophage polarization. CD47 inhibition combined with SDT to synergistically modulate TAMs may induce superior effects for OS treatment.

The effective integration of ultrasound imaging and sonodynamic therapy (SDT) into one nanoplatform remains an enormous challenge yet to be fully resolved. Here, a novel theranostic system, consisting of rattle-type SiO2 (r-SiO2) loaded with Mn-doped In2S3/InOOH (SMISO), was designed and synthesized to enable an improved ultrasound imaging-guided therapy. With Mn-doped In2S3/InOOH (MISO) and a heterojunction structure, this novel sonosensitizer facilitates the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) for SDT. By coupling interfaces between the shell and core in rattle-type SiO2, multiple reflections/scattering are generated, while MISO has high acoustic impedance. By integrating r-SiO2 and MISO, the SMISO composite nanoparticles (NPs) increase the acoustic reflection and provide enhanced contrast for ultrasound imaging. Through the effective accumulation in tumors, which was monitored by B-mode ultrasound imaging in vivo, SMISO composite NPs effectively inhibited tumor growth without adverse side effects under ultrasound irradiation treatment.

Photodynamic therapy (PDT), which induces cancer cell apoptosis via light-triggered production of reactive oxygen species, is a promising method.

The synthetic molecule could self-assemble into nanoparticles (TPIMBS NPs) and be stabilized with amphiphilic block copolymers for enhanced accumulation in tumor sites through passive targeting while reducing the leakage in normal tissues. Through photochemical internalization, TPIMBS NPs preferentially concentrated in the lysosomes of cancer cells and generated reactive oxygen species (ROS) upon light irradiation, resulting in lysosomal rupture and release of PSs to the cytosol, which led to cell apoptosis. Further, the photoinduced release of Ag+ from TPIMBS NPs could act as chemotherapy, significantly improving the overall therapeutic efficacy by synergistic effects with PDT.

MDNPs presented homologous targeting accumulation and in vivo long-term circulation ability. They effectively passed through the blood-brain barrier (BBB) under US assistance and reached the orthotopic GBM site. MDNPs exhibited controllable US-elicited sonodynamic effect by generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). ROS not only induced cancer cell apoptosis but also downregulated drug-resistance-related factors to disrupt chemoresistance and increase sensitivity to chemotherapy. The in vivo study of orthotopic GBM treatments further proved that MDNPs exhibited US-augmented synergistic antitumor efficacy and strongly prolonged the survival rate of mice. The use of low-dose DOX and the safety of US enabled repeated treatment (4 times) without obvious cardiotoxicity.

Herein, an intelligent nanoplatform is reported that selectively acts as reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavenger in normal tissue but as ROS generator in tumor microenvironment (TME) to differentially control ROS level in tumor and surrounding normal tissue during PDT. By down-regulating the produced ROS with dampened cytokine wave in normal tissue after PDT, the nanoplatform reduces the inflammatory response of normal tissue in PDT, minimizing the side effect and tumor metastasis in PDT. Alternatively, the nanoplatform switches from ROS scavenger to generator through the glutathione (GSH) responsive degradation in TME, which effectively improves the PDT efficacy with reduced GSH level and amplified oxidative stress in tumor. Simultaneously, the released Mn ions provide real-time and in situ signal change of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to monitor the reversal process of catalysis activity and achieve accurate tumor diagnosis.

Due to the mild acidity of the tumor microenvironment (TME), the Ca3(PO4)2 shell degraded first, releasing substantial quantities of calcium ions (Ca2+) and DOX. Meanwhile, with the ultrasound (US) irradiation, MnCO3 produced enough reactive oxygen species (ROS) to cause oxidative stress in the cells, resulting in accumulation of Ca2+. Consequently, the cascade effect significantly amplified the therapeutic effect.

Taking the unique advantages of POPs with designable structures and high specific surface area, this H-Pys-HA@M/R nanosonosensitizer can achieve tumor target accumulation, GSH-triggered drug release, and low-frequency ultrasound-activating ROS generation with encouraging results. Furthermore, this multifunctional nanosonosensitizer can effectively evoke immunogenic cell death (ICD) response through the combination of SDT and chemotherapy for both primary and distal tumor growth suppression. Meanwhile, H-Pys-HA@M/R exhibits favorable biodegradation and biosafety. Therefore, this study provides a new strategy for reasonably designing and constructing POP-related sonosensitizers combining SDT/chemotherapy/immunotherapy triple treatment modalities to eradicate malignant tumors.",ACS applied materials & interfaces,2022,downloaded,10.1021/acsami.2c14776
36250626,All-in-One Theranostic Platforms: Deep-Red AIE Nanocrystals to Target Dual-Organelles for Efficient Photodynamic Therapy.,"Aggregation-induced emission (AIE) nanoparticles have been widely applied in photodynamic therapy (PDT) over the past few years. However, amorphous nanoaggregates usually occur in their preparation, resulting in loose packing with disordered molecular structures. This still allows free intramolecular motions, thus leading to limited brightness and PDT efficiency. Herein, we report deep-red AIE nanocrystals (NCs) of DTPA-BS-F by following the facile method of nanoprecipitation. It is observed that DTPA-BS-F NCs possess not only a high photoluminescence quantum yield value of 8% in the deep-red region (600-850 nm) but also an impressive reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation efficiency of up to 69%. Moreover, DTPA-BS-F NCs targeting dual-organelles of lysosomes and nucleus to generate ROS are also achieved, thus boosting the PDT effect in cancer therapy both in vitro and in vivo. This work provides high-performance AIE NCs to simultaneously target two organelles for efficient photodynamic therapy, indicating their promising application in all-in-one theranostic platforms.",ACS nano,2022,downloaded,10.1021/acsnano.2c04465.s001
36226462,A dual-functional nanoplatform based on NIR and green dual-emissive persistent luminescence nanoparticles for X-ray excited persistent luminescence imaging and photodynamic therapy.,"Persistent luminescence nanoparticles (PLNPs) possess advantages for high-sensitivity bioimaging and continuous photodynamic therapy (PDT) because they can emit persistent luminescence (PerL) after excitation ceases. However, PLNPs are limited to single-wavelength emission, which can only efficiently realize one of the functions of bioimaging or PDT. In addition, most PLNPs are excited by shallow tissue penetrating excitation light, which makes it difficult to achieve repeatable in vivo applications with high efficiency. Herein, X-ray-excited PLNPs (Zn3Ga2Ge2O10:Cr3+,Mn2+, ZGGCM) with dual emission for in vivo X-rays repeatedly activated PerL imaging and tumor PDT are reported for the first time. ZGGCM exhibits dual-emission peaks after X-ray excitation/re-excitation, located at 698 nm and 532 nm, respectively. Additionally, ZGGCM is modified with the photosensitizer rose bengal (RB) to construct a dual-functional nanoplatform based on PerL imaging and PDT. The results indicate that the PerL emission peak (698 nm) of Cr3+ ions in ZGGCM possesses excellent near-infrared (NIR) PerL imaging performance, and the green PerL emission peak (532 nm) of Mn2+ ions can activate RB effectively and generate reactive oxygen species (ROS), thereby causing a significant antitumor effect. This unique dual-functional nanoplatform is expected to further promote the application of PLNPs in the integration of efficient tumor diagnosis and treatment.",Nanoscale,2022,not_downloaded,10.1039/d2nr03631b
36043358,Collagenase-Loaded H-TiO2 Nanoparticles Enhance Ultrasound Imaging-Guided Sonodynamic Therapy in a Pancreatic Carcinoma Xenograft Model via Digesting Stromal Barriers.,"Sonodynamic therapy (SDT), a noninvasive therapy that relies on sonosensitizers and generates reactive oxygen species (ROS), has attracted considerable attention in the treatment of pancreatic cancer. However, being surrounded by dense stromal barriers, pancreatic cancer exhibits high interstitial fluid pressure (IFP) and hypoxia in the tumor microenvironment (TME), resulting in poor SDT efficacy. Collagenase-loaded hollow TiO2 (Col-H-TiO2) nanoparticles (NPs) capable of degrading stromal barriers and producing sufficient ROS production were synthesized in this study. After administration of NPs in the patient-derived xenograft (PDX) model, ultrasonic irradiation-released collagenase degraded tumor matrix fibers, decreased intratumoral IFP, and enhanced the penetration and retention of NPs within tumor tissues. Moreover, the NPs accumulated within the tumor not only generate abundant ROS under the influence of ultrasound irradiation but also improve intratumoral ultrasound signal, providing ultrasonic imaging-guided highly effective SDT for pancreatic cancer. In conclusion, this research improves the SDT technique and enhances the visualization of pancreatic cancer by remodeling the TME and is a promising strategy for further clinical applications.",ACS applied materials & interfaces,2022,downloaded,10.1021/acsami.2c08951
35997705,Tumor Microenvironment-Responsive Cu/CaCO3 -Based Nanoregulator for Mitochondrial Homeostasis Disruption-Enhanced Chemodynamic/Sonodynamic Therapy.,"The efficiency of reactive oxygen species (ROS)-mediated cancer therapy is restrained by intrinsic characteristics in the tumor microenvironment (TME), such as overexpressed glutathione (GSH), hypoxia and limited efficiency of H2 O2 . In this work, intelligent copper-dropped calcium carbonate loading sonosensitizer Ce6 nanoparticles (Cu/CaCO3 @Ce6, CCC NPs) are established to realize TME-responsive self-supply of oxygen and successively Ca2+ -overloading-strengthened chemodynamic therapy/sonodynamic therapy (CDT/SDT). CCC NPs release Ca2+ , Cu2+ , and Ce6 in weakly acid and GSH-excessive TME. Released Cu2+ can not only consume GSH and turn into Cu+ via a redox reaction, but also provide CDT-creating hydroxyl radicals through the Fenton-like reaction. Under ultrasound irradiation, the intracellular oxidative stress is amplified profoundly relying on singlet oxygen outburst from SDT. Moreover, Ca2+ influx aggravates the mitochondrial disruption, which further accelerates the oxidation level. The facile and feasible design of the Cu-dropped CaCO3 -based nanoregulators will be further developed as a paradigm in ROS-contributed cancer therapy.","Small (Weinheim an der Bergstrasse, Germany)",2022,downloaded,10.1002/smll.202204047
35923138,Cycloacceleration of Reactive Oxygen Species Generation Based on Exceedingly Small Magnetic Iron Oxide Nanoparticles for Tumor Ferroptosis Therapy.,"Because of the insufficiency of hydrogen peroxide, the relatively low rate of Fenton reaction, and the active glutathione (GSH) peroxidase 4 (GPX4) in tumor cells, it is difficult to achieve a desirable efficacy of ferroptosis therapy (FT) for tumors based on nanomaterials. Inspired by the concept of ""cyclotron"" in physics, in this study, a new concept of cycloacceleration of reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation in tumor cells to realize high-performance FT of tumors is proposed. Typically, a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) contrast agent of dotted core-shell Fe3 O4 /Gd2 O3 hybrid nanoparticles (FGNPs) is prepared based on exceedingly small magnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (ES-MIONs). Sorafenib (SFN) is loaded and poly(ethylene glycol) methyl ether-poly(propylene sulfide)-NH2 (mPEG-PPS-NH2 ) is grafted on the surface of FGNP to generate SA-SFN-FGNP via self-assembly. The results of in vitro and in vivo demonstrate SA-SFN-FGNP can work with the acidic tumor microenvironment and endosomal conditions, Fenton reaction and system XC - , and generate cyclic reactions in tumor cells, resulting in specific cycloacceleration of ROS generation for high-performance FT of tumors. The very high longitudinal relaxivity (r1 , 33.43 mM-1 s-1 , 3.0 T) makes sure that the SA-SFN-FGNP can be used for MRI-guided FT of tumors.","Small (Weinheim an der Bergstrasse, Germany)",2022,downloaded,10.1002/smll.202202705
35876015,Multifunctional Magnetic CuS/Gd2O3 Nanoparticles for Fluorescence/Magnetic Resonance Bimodal Imaging-Guided Photothermal-Intensified Chemodynamic Synergetic Therapy of Targeted Tumors.,"Chemodynamic therapy (CDT), which consumes endogenous hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) to generate reactive oxygen species (ROS) and causes oxidative damage to tumor cells, shows tremendous promise for advanced cancer treatment. However, the rate of ROS generation based on the Fenton reaction is prone to being restricted by inadequate H2O2 and unattainable acidity in the hypoxic tumor microenvironment. We herein report a multifunctional nanoprobe (BCGCR) integrating bimodal imaging and photothermal-enhanced CDT of the targeted tumor, which is produced by covalent conjugation of bovine serum albumin-stabilized CuS/Gd2O3 nanoparticles (NPs) with the Cy5.5 fluorophore and the tumor-targeting ligand RGD. BCGCR exhibits intense near-infrared (NIR) fluorescence and acceptable r1 relaxivity (∼15.3 mM-1 s-1) for both sensitive fluorescence imaging and high-spatial-resolution magnetic resonance imaging of tumors in living mice. Moreover, owing to the strong NIR absorbance from the internal CuS NPs, BCGCR can generate localized heat and displays a high photothermal conversion efficiency (30.3%) under 980 nm laser irradiation, which enables photothermal therapy and further intensifies ROS generation arising from the Cu-induced Fenton-like reaction for enhanced CDT. This synergetic effect shows such an excellent therapeutic efficacy that it can ablate xenografted tumors in vivo. We believe that this strategy will be beneficial to exploring other advanced nanomaterials for the clinical application of multimodal imaging-guided synergetic cancer therapies.",ACS applied materials & interfaces,2022,downloaded,10.1021/acsami.2c06503.s001
35845146,Integrating Au and ZnO nanoparticles onto graphene nanosheet for enhanced sonodynamic therapy.,"Sonodynamic therapy has attracted widespread attention for cancer treatment because of its noninvasiveness and high tissue-penetration ability. Generally, ultrasound irradiation of sonosensitizers produces separated electrons (e-) and holes (h+), which inhibits cancer by producing reactive oxygen species (ROS). However, the separated electrons (e-) and holes (h+) could easily recombine, lowering the yield of ROS and hindering the application of sonodynamic therapy (SDT). Herein, we present a highly efficient sonosensitizer system for enhanced sonodynamic therapy built on reduced graphene oxide (rGO) nanosheets, bridged ZnO and Au nanoparticles, coated with polyvinyl pyrrolidone (PVP). The ultrasound irradiation activates ZnO nanoparticles to generate separated electron-hole (e--h+) pairs, and the rGO nanosheets facilitate electron transfer from ZnO to Au nanoparticles because of the narrow band gap of rGO, which could efficiently restrain the recombination of the e--h+ pairs, thereby significantly augmenting the production of ROS to kill cancer cells, such as U373MG, HeLa, and CT26 cells. Moreover, rGO nanosheets integrated with Au nanoparticles could catalyze the endogenous decomposition of H2O2 into O2, which can alleviate hypoxic tumor microenvironment (TME). Therefore, the rational design of Au-rGO-ZnO@PVP nanomaterials can not only improve the efficiency of sonodynamic therapy, but also mitigate the hypoxic tumor microenvironment, which would provide a new perspective in the development of efficient sonosensitizers.",Nano research,2022,not_downloaded,10.1007/s12274-022-4599-5

Herein, a self-sacrificially biodegradable pseudo-semiconducting polymer (PSP) for NIR-II fluorescence bioimaging, photodynamic immunotherapy, and photoactivated chemotherapy (PACT) is reported. The PSP can further co-assemble with an amphiphilic polyester with pendant doxorubicin (DOX) in its side chains via reactive oxygen species (ROS)-responsive thioketal linkages (PEDOX ), which are denoted as NP@PEDOX /PSP. The NP@PEDOX /PSP can accumulate at tumor sites and generate ROS for photodynamic immunotherapy as well as near-infrared-II fluorescence (NIR-II) for bioimaging upon irradition at 808 nm. The ROS could break up thioketal linkages in PEDOX , resulting in rapid doxorubicin (DOX) release for PACT. Finally, both PEDOX and PSP are degraded sacrificially by intracellular glutathione (GSH), resulting in the dissociation of NP@PEDOX /PSP. This work highlights the application of self-sacrificially degradable PSP for NIR-II fluorescence bioimaging, photodynamic immunotherapy, and PACT in cancer therapy.","Advanced materials (Deerfield Beach, Fla.)",2022,downloaded,10.1002/adma.202203820
35730906,Free-Radical Cascade Generated by AIPH/Fe3O4-Coloaded Nanoparticles Enhances MRI-Guided Chemo/Thermodynamic Hypoxic Tumor Therapy.,"Free radicals, including reactive oxygen species (ROS), play a critical role in determining cell's fate. When the level of free radicals is increased to a fatal value, it causes cancer cells to undergo senescence or cell death. Strategies that target this mechanism offer promising therapies against cancer. However, efficient and sustainable systems that generate free radicals, especially oxygen-independent systems, remain deficient. Herein, functionalized PLGA-based nanocomposites that efficiently co-deliver magnetic nanoparticles and 2,2'-azobis[2-(2-imidazolin-2-yl) propane]-dihydrochloride (AIPH) were fabricated to achieve photothermal-induced thermodynamic therapy combined with macrophage polarization strategies; this therapy targets hypoxic tumors through the generation of an oxygen-independent free-radical cascade. These hybrid NPs can accumulate in the tumor microenvironment, and the encapsulated MNPs not only serve as contrast agents for enhanced magnetic resonance imaging but also exhibit the expected photothermal conversion and trigger the decomposition of AIPH to generate free radicals, thus causing cancer cell death. More importantly, the cell debris from apoptotic or necrotic cancer cells carries nondegraded MNPs, which can be endocytosed by recruited TAMs. MNPs can further induce TAMs to polarize to the M1 subtype to subsequently generate ROS. This study provides an alternative method for the generation of an oxygen-independent free-radical cascade for tumor co-therapy guided by magnetic resonance imaging PTT/TDT.",ACS applied materials & interfaces,2022,downloaded,10.1021/acsami.2c05748

The ability of the nanosystem to encapsulate hydrophilic and hydrophobic molecules has been demonstrated, and their enhanced cellular uptake has been observed in vitro. The PDPC NPs, surface coated with gold by in situ reduction of chloroauric acid (PDPC-Au NPs), showed a photothermal transduction efficacy of ∼65%. The PDPC-Au NPs demonstrated an increase in intracellular ROS, triggered DNA damage and resulted in apoptotic cell death when tested against breast cancer cells (MCF-7). The disintegration of PDPC-Au NPs into smaller nanoparticles with near-infrared (NIR) laser irradiation was understood using transmission electron microscopy imaging. The lipo-polymeric hybrid nanosystem exhibited plasmon-enhanced fluorescence when loaded with IR780 (a NIR dye), followed by surface coating with gold (PDPC-IR-Au NPs). This paper is one of the first reports on the plasmon-enhanced fluorescence within a nanosystem by simple surface coating of Au, to the best of our knowledge. This plasmon-enhanced fluorescence was unique to the lipo-polymeric hybrid system, as the same was not observed with a liposomal nanosystem. The plasmon-enhanced fluorescence of PDPC-IR-Au NPs, when applied for imaging cancer cells and zebrafish embryos, showed a strong fluorescence signal at minimal concentrations of the dye. The PDPC-IR-Au NPs were also applied for photothermal therapy of breast cancer in vitro and in vivo, and the results depicted significant therapeutic benefits.",Nanoscale,2022,downloaded,10.1039/d2nr01378a
35639357,Two-Dimensional MXene-Originated In Situ Nanosonosensitizer Generation for Augmented and Synergistic Sonodynamic Tumor Nanotherapy.,"Despite the merits of high tissue-penetrating depth, no ionizing radiation, and low cost, sonodynamic therapy (SDT) still suffers from a low quantum yield of reactive oxygen species (ROS), limited delivery efficiency, and potential toxicity of sonosensitizers. Different from the direct delivery of sonosensitizers into tumor tissue for SDT, this work reports the fabrication of two-dimensional (2D) nanosonosensitizers/nanocatalysts (Ti3C2/CuO2@BSA) for the in situ generation of nanosonosensitizers by responding to the tumor microenvironment, achieving the high-performance and synergistic sonodynamic/chemodynamic tumor therapy. CuO2 nanoparticle integration on 2D Ti3C2 MXene achieved in situ H2O2 generation in an acidic tumor microenvironment for oxidizing Ti3C2 to produce TiO2 nanosonosensitizers, accompanied by the enhanced separation of electrons (e-) and holes (h+) by the carbon matrix after oxidation, further augmenting the SDT efficacy. Ultrasound irradiation during the sonodynamic process also enhanced the Cu-initiated Fenton-like reaction to produce more ROS for synergizing the sonodynamic tumor therapy. The experimental results confirm and demonstrate the synergistic therapeutic effects of chemodynamic and sonodynamic nanotherapy both in vitro and in vivo. The antitumor mechanisms of synergistic chemodynamic and sonodynamic therapies are associated with the upregulation of oxidative phosphorylation, ROS generation, and apoptosis as demonstrated by RNA sequencing. This work thus provides a distinct paradigm of 2D MXene-originated in situ nanosonosensitizer generation for augmented and synergistic sonodynamic tumor nanotherapy.",ACS nano,2022,downloaded,10.1021/acsnano.2c04630

Stimuli-responsive biodegradable nanoagents that can achieve not only delivery and controlled release of chemotherapeutics, but also hypoxia alleviation to enhance chemoradiotherapy therefore has tremendous potential. Herein, glutathione (GSH)-responsive, biodegradable, doxorubicin-carrying hollow mesoporous organotantalum nanospheres modified with Au and Pt dual nanoenzymes (HMOTP@Pt@Au@Dox) were constructed for chemo-radio sensitization. Degradation of HMOTP@Pt@Au@Dox can be self-activated through GSH stimulation and on-demand release packaged Dox owing to the disulfide bond in the hybrid framework of organotantalum nanospheres. Au and Pt nanoenzymes triggered cascade catalytic reactions that could alleviate hypoxia by utilizing β-d-glucose and H2O2, thereby sensitizing ROS-based chemoradiotherapy with synergistic starving therapy. Given the radiosensitization of high-Z elements (Ta, Pt, Au), nanoenzymes induced cascade catalytic reaction for hypoxia relief, and the depletion of the predominant antioxidant GSH, desirable tumor suppression could be achieved both in vitro and in vivo, indicating that HMOTP@Pt@Au@Dox is a promising nanoagent to boost chemo-radiotherapy.",Journal of controlled release : official journal of the Controlled Release Society,2022,downloaded,10.1016/j.jconrel.2022.05.018
35357810,Sequential Ultrasound-Triggered and Hypoxia-Sensitive Nanoprodrug for Cascade Amplification of Sonochemotherapy.,"Hypoxia, the typical and conspicuous characteristic of most solid tumors, worsens the tumor invasiveness and metastasis. Here, we engineered a sequential ultrasound (US)/hypoxia-sensitive sonochemotherapeutic nanoprodrug by initially synthesizing the hypoxia-activated azo bond-containing camptothecin (CPT) prodrug (CPT2-Azo) and then immobilizing it into the mesopores of sonosensitizer-integrated metal organic frameworks (MOF NPs). Upon entering the hypoxic tumor microenvironment (TME), the structure of CPT2-Azo immobilized MOFs (denoted as MCA) was ruptured and the loaded nontoxic CPT2-Azo prodrug was released from the MOF NPs. Under US actuation, this sonochemotherapeutic nanoprodrug not only promoted sonosensitizer-mediated sonodynamic therapy (SDT) via the conversion of oxygen into cytotoxic reactive oxygen species (ROS) but also aggravated hypoxia in the TME by elevating oxygen consumption. The exacerbated hypoxia in turn served as a positive amplifier to boost the activation of CPT2-Azo, and the controllable release of toxic chemotherapeutic drug (CPT), and compensated the insufficient treatment efficacy of SDT. In vitro and in vivo evaluations confirmed that sequential SDT and tumor hypoxia-activated sonochemotherapy promoted the utmost of tumor hypoxia and thereby contributed to the augmented antitumor efficacy, resulting in conspicuous apoptotic cell death and noteworthy tumor suppression in vivo. Our work provides a distinctive insight into the exploitation of the hypoxia-activated sonochemotherapeutic nanoprodrug that utilizes the hypoxic condition in TME, a side effect of SDT, to initiate chemotherapy, thus causing a significantly augmented treatment outcome compared to conventional SDT.",ACS nano,2022,downloaded,10.1021/acsnano.1c09505.s001

However, the remotely collective perception and precise propelling in a low Reynold's number bioenvironment remain the major challenges of microrobots to achieve desired therapeutic effects in vivo. Here, we reported a biohybrid microrobot that integrated with magnetic, thermal, and hypoxia sensitivities and an internal fluorescent protein as the dual reporter of thermal and positioning signals for targeted cancer treatment. There were three key elements in the microrobotic system, including the magnetic nanoparticle (MNP)-loaded probiotic Escherichia coli Nissle1917 (EcN@MNP) for spatially magnetic and hypoxia perception, a thermal-logic circuit engineered into the bacteria to control the biosynthesis of mCherry as the temperature and positioning reporter, and NDH-2 enzyme encoded in the EcN for enhanced anticancer therapy. According to the fluorescent-protein-based imaging feedback, the microrobot showed good thermal sensitivity and active targeting ability to the tumor area in a collective manner under the magnetic field. The cancer cell apoptosis was efficiently triggered in vitro and in vivo by the hybrid microrobot coupled with the effects of magnetothermal ablation and NDH-2-induced reactive oxygen species (ROS) damage. Our study demonstrates that the biohybrid EcN microrobot is an ideal platform to integrate the physical, biological, and chemical properties for collective perception and propelling in targeted cancer treatment.",ACS nano,2022,not_downloaded,10.1021/acsnano.1c11601.s002
35293920,Rational design of ROS-responsive nanocarriers for targeted X-ray-induced photodynamic therapy and cascaded chemotherapy of intracranial glioblastoma.,"Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most lethal primary intracranial tumor because of its high invasiveness and recurrence. Therefore, nanocarriers with blood-brain barrier (BBB) penetration and transcranial-controlled drug release and activation are rather attractive options for glioblastoma treatment. Herein, we designed a multifunctional nanocarrier (T-TKNPVP) that combined targeted X-ray-induced photodynamic therapy (X-PDT) and cascaded reactive oxygen species (ROS)-boosted chemotherapy. The T-TKNPVP loaded with verteporfin (VP) and paclitaxel (PTX) was self-assembled from an angiopep-2 (Ang) peptide, functionalized Ang-PEG-DSPE and ROS-sensitive PEG-TK-PTX conjugate. After systemic injection, the T-TKNPVP efficiently crossed the BBB and targeted the GBM cells via receptor-mediated transcytosis. Upon X-ray irradiation, they can generate a certain amount of ROS, which not only induces X-PDT but also locoregionally activates PTX release and action by cleaving the TK bridged bonds. As evidenced by 9.4 T MRI and other experiments, such nanocarriers offer significant growth inhibition of GBM in situ and prolong the survival times of U87-MG tumor-bearing mice. Taken together, the designed T-TKNPVP provided an alternative avenue for realizing transcranial X-PDT and X-ray-activated chemotherapy for targeted and locoregional GBM treatment in vivo.",Nanoscale,2022,not_downloaded,10.1039/d2nr00436d
35286853,Chemiluminescence resonance energy transfer-based immunostimulatory nanoparticles for sonoimmunotherapy.,"Sonodynamic therapy (SDT) has recently emerged as a promising alternative to photodynamic therapy because of its applicability in treating deeply located tumors accessible by ultrasound (US). However, the therapeutic potential of conventional sonosensitizers is limited by the low quantum yield of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and poor immune responses eliciting canonical apoptosis of cancer cells. Herein, we report chemiluminescence resonance energy transfer (CRET)-based immunostimulatory nanoparticles (iCRET NPs) for sonoimmunotherapy, which not only amplify the ROS quantum yield of sonosensitizers but also generate carbon dioxide (CO2) bubbles to induce immunogenic cell death in the tumor microenvironment (TME). Owing to their CRET phenomena responsive to H2O2 in the TME, iCRET NPs exhibit strong cytotoxicity to cancer cells by producing a large quantity of ROS. Additionally, iCRET NPs effectively induce CO2-mediated immunogenic cell death by rupturing the cancer cell membrane in the presence of US, leading to the release of bare damage-associated molecular patterns, such as HSP 70 and HMGB1. Consequently, when iCRET NPs are combined with anti-PD-1 antibodies, iCRET NPs exhibit synergistic effects in 4T1 tumor-bearing mice, in which antitumor immunity is remarkably amplified to inhibit tumor growth and metastasis.",Biomaterials,2022,downloaded,10.1016/j.biomaterials.2022.121466
35156370,Nano-ultrasonic Contrast Agent for Chemoimmunotherapy of Breast Cancer by Immune Metabolism Reprogramming and Tumor Autophagy.,"The functional status of innate immune cells is a considerable determinant of effective antitumor immune response. However, the triple-negative breast cancer tumor microenvironment with high lactic acid metabolism and high antioxidant levels limits immune cell survival, differentiation, and function. Here, we determine that the tumor microenvironment-responsive nano-ultrasonic contrast agent Pt(IV)/CQ/PFH NPs-DPPA-1 boosts the ratio of mature dendritic cells (mDCs) and proinflammatory macrophages by reprogramming the metabolism of immature DCs (iDCs) and tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs). Specifically, platinum(IV) in cancer cells or iDCs was reduced to cisplatin, which can increase the intracellular content of ROS and therefore enhance the ratio of mDCs and apoptotic tumor cells. Meanwhile, chloroquine (CQ) released from nanoparticles (NPs) minimizes protective autophagy caused by cisplatin in tumor cells and reprograms the metabolism of TAMs to enhance the proportion of proinflammatory macrophages, achieving a superior synergistic effect of chemoimmunotherapy combined with Pt(IV) and anti-PD-L1 peptide (DPPA-1). Furthermore, perfluorohexane (PFH) in NPs realizes monitoring treatment corresponding to ultrasound.

However, due to the lack of a corresponding theranostic agent, it faces a great challenge for practical clinical implementation. Here, we present a single diagnostic and therapeutic nanoplatform named carbon nitride nanoparticles (CN-NPs) for efficient NIR-II PAI-guided photodynamic therapy (PDT)/photothermal therapy (PTT). The CN-NPs were obtained by incorporating an aromatic compound (PTCDA) with a large π-structure into melem by high-temperature polymerization. The absorption of the obtained CN-NPs was significantly enhanced compared with pristine melem. Under 1064 nm laser illumination, sufficient reactive oxygen species (ROS) generated by CN-NPs could reduce the mitochondrial membrane potential. Moreover, the CN-NPs exhibited an efficient PTT effect through improved photothermal stability and high photo-to-heat conversion efficiency (47.6%). We were also able to monitor the accumulation and metabolism of CN-NPs in vivo of mice in real time using PAI. The in vivo experiments proved that the CN-NPs could inhibit tumor growth and recurrence completely under 1064 nm. Thus, the proposed innovative strategy would open a new avenue to explore and construct NIR-II responsive nanoplatforms with enhanced performance and safety for multimodal phototheranostics.",ACS applied materials & interfaces,2022,downloaded,10.1021/acsami.1c22481.s001
35061388,Ultrasmall Magneto-chiral Cobalt Hydroxide Nanoparticles Enable Dynamic Detection of Reactive Oxygen Species in Vivo.,"Biological application of chiral nanoparticles (NPs) has aroused enormous levels of attention over recent years. Here, we synthesized magneto-chiral cobalt hydroxide (Co(OH)2) NPs that exhibited strong chiroptical and unique magnetic properties and applied these NPs to detect and monitor reactive oxygen species (ROS) in living cells and in vivo. Circular dichroism (CD) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) signals of the magneto-chiral Co(OH)2 NPs exhibited a wide intracellular ROS detection range from 0.673 to 612.971 pmol/106 cells with corresponding limits of detection (LOD) at 0.087 and 0.179 pmol/106 cells, far below that of currently available probes; the LOD for d-aspartic acid coated Co(OH)2 NPs (d-Co(OH)2 NPs) was 5.7 times lower than that for l-aspartic acid coated Co(OH)2 NPs (l-Co(OH)2 NPs) based on the CD signals. In addition, d-Co(OH)2 NPs also exhibited dynamic ROS monitoring ability. The high levels of selectivity and sensitivity to ROS in complex biological environments can be attributed to the Co2+ oxidation reaction on the surface of the NPs. Furthermore, magneto-chiral Co(OH)2 NPs were able to quantify the levels of ROS in living mice by fluorescence and MRI signals. Collectively, these results reveal that magneto-chiral Co(OH)2 NPs exhibit a remarkable ability to quantify ROS levels in living organisms, and could therefore provide new tools for exploring chiral nanomaterials as a potential biosensor to investigate biological events.",Journal of the American Chemical Society,2022,downloaded,10.1021/jacs.1c09986.s001
35005898,Efficient Magnetic Nanocatalyst-Induced Chemo- and Ferroptosis Synergistic Cancer Therapy in Combination with T1-T2 Dual-Mode Magnetic Resonance Imaging Through Doxorubicin Delivery.,"Excessive iron ions in cancer cells can catalyze H2O2 into highly toxic •OH and then promote the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), inducing cancer ferroptosis. However, the efficacy of the ferroptosis catalyst is still insufficient because of low Fe(II) release, which severely limited its application in clinic. Herein, we developed a novel magnetic nanocatalyst for MRI-guided chemo- and ferroptosis synergistic cancer therapies through iRGD-PEG-ss-PEG-modified gadolinium engineering magnetic iron oxide-loaded Dox (ipGdIO-Dox). The introduction of the gadolinium compound disturbed the structure of ipGdIO-Dox, making the magnetic nanocatalyst be more sensitive to weak acid. When ipGdIO-Dox entered into cancer cells, abundant Fe(II) ions were released and then catalyzed H2O2 into highly toxic OH•, which would elevate cellular oxidative stress to damage mitochondria and cell membranes and induce cancer ferroptosis. In addition, the iRGD-PEG-ss-PEG chain coated onto the nanoplatform was also broken by high expression of GSH, and then, the Dox was released. This process not only effectively inhibited DNA replication but also further activated cellular ROS, making the nanoplatform achieve stronger anticancer ability. Besides, the systemic delivery of ipGdIO-Dox significantly enhanced the T1- and T2-weighted MRI signal of the tumor, endowing accurate diagnostic capability for tumor recognition. Therefore, ipGdIO-Dox might be a promising candidate for developing an MRI-guided chemo- and ferroptosis synergistic theranostic system.",ACS applied materials & interfaces,2022,downloaded,10.21203/rs.3.rs-810122/v1

Benefitting from the glucose transporter 5 (GLUT5)-mediated endocytosis, our Fru-MnP nanoplatform produces a high level of reactive oxygen species (ROS) via the Mn2+-driven Fenton reaction within osteosarcoma cells, leading to efficient cancer cell killing due to caspase-mediated apoptosis. By virtue of the T1 signal enhancement of Mn2+, our Fru-MnP nanoplatform also acts as an effective tumour-specific MRI contrast agent, realizing the MRI-monitored chemodynamic therapy. The proposed synergistic therapeutic platform opens new possibilities for high efficacy therapy for osteosarcoma.",Nanoscale,2022,not_downloaded,10.1039/d1nr06220d
34982524,Ultrasound-Enhanced Reactive Oxygen Species Responsive Charge-Reversal Polymeric Nanocarriers for Efficient Pancreatic Cancer Gene Delivery.,"Inefficient intracellular gene release and transfection limit nonviral gene delivery applications in cancer therapy. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) responsive nonviral gene delivery is the most widely explored strategy for such applications, yet the development of fast and safe ROS responsive nanocarriers proves to be a challenge because of the intracellular chemical equilibrium of high ROS and glutathione levels. Here, we report an ultrasound-enhanced ROS responsive charge-reversal polymeric nanocarrier (BTIL) for fast and efficient pancreatic cancer gene delivery. The BTIL is composed of B-PDEAEA/DNA polyplex-based cores and IR780-loaded liposome coatings. The IR780 is able to produce an excess of ROS under low intensity ultrasound irradiation, thus disequilibrating the chemical equilibrium of ROS and glutathione, and promoting the ROS-responsive positive-to-negative charge-reversal of the B-PDEAEA polymer. This charge conversion results in fast polyplex dissociation and intracellular gene release, inducing efficient gene transfection and cancer cell apoptosis. Moreover, following the intravenous administration, BTIL maintains a stable and long circulation in the bloodstream, achieves orthotopic pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma distribution, and exhibits potent antitumor activity with negligible side effects. Our results reveal the proposed strategy to be both promising and universal for the development of fast and safe ROS responsive nonviral gene delivery in cancer therapy.",ACS applied materials & interfaces,2022,downloaded,10.1021/acsami.1c20030
34935343,Dual-Responsive and ROS-Augmented Nanoplatform for Chemo/Photodynamic/Chemodynamic Combination Therapy of Triple Negative Breast Cancer.,"Integrating chemodynamic therapy (CDT) and photodynamic therapy (PDT) into one nanoplatform can produce much more reactive oxygen species (ROS) for tumor therapy. Nevertheless, it is still a great challenge to selectively generate sufficient ROS in tumor regions. Meanwhile, CDT and PDT are restricted by insufficient H2O2 content in the tumor as well as by the limited tumor tissue penetration of the light source. In this study, a smart pH/ROS-responsive nanoplatform, Fe2+@UCM-BBD, is rationally designed for tumor combination therapy. The acidic microenvironment can induce the pH-responsive release of doxorubicin (DOX), which can induce tumor apoptosis through DNA damage. Beyond that, DOX can promote the production of H2O2, providing sufficient materials for CDT. Of note, upconversion nanoparticles at the core can convert the 980 nm light to red and green light, which are used to activate Ce6 to produce singlet oxygen (1O2) and achieve upconversion luminescence imaging, respectively. Then, the ROS-responsive linker bis-(alkylthio)alkene is cleaved by 1O2, resulting in the release of Fenton reagent (Fe2+) to realize CDT. Taken together, Fe2+@UCM-BBD exhibits on-demand therapeutic reagent release capability, excellent biocompatibility, and remarkable tumor inhibition ability via synergistic chemo/photodynamic/chemodynamic combination therapy.",ACS applied materials & interfaces,2022,downloaded,10.1021/acsami.1c14135
34928122,Nanotransferrin-Based Programmable Catalysis Mediates Three-Pronged Induction of Oxidative Stress to Enhance Cancer Immunotherapy.,"Current oxidative stress amplifying strategies for immunogenic cell death (ICD) promotion are mainly restricted to immune tolerance induced by adaptive cellular antioxidation, limited tumor-selectivity, and tumoral immunosuppression. Herein, a facile and efficient scenario of genetically engineering transferrin-expressing cell membrane nanovesicle encapsulated IR820-dihydroartemisinin nanomedicine (Tf@IR820-DHA) was developed to boost a-PD-L1-mediated immune checkpoint blocking (ICB) via synergetic triple stimuli-activated oxidative stress-associated ICD. We demonstrate that the engineered transferrin of Tf@IR820-DHA has excellent tumor targeting and Fe(III)-loading properties and thus delivered Fe(III) and IR820-DHA nanoparticles (NPs) to the lesion location effectively. We found that the self-carrying Fe(III)-mediated programmable catalysis of DHA and glutathione (GSH) depletion generated plenty of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Moreover, DHA also acted as an immunomodulator to decrease the number of T regulatory cells, thereby remodeling the tumor immune microenvironment and achieving double T cell activation. Furthermore, the IR820 molecule served as a competent sonosensitizer to produce ROS under ultrasound activation and guide precise immunotherapy via fluorescent/photoacoustic (FL/PA) imaging. Through its three-pronged delivery of stimuli-activated oxidative stress (DHA-induced chemodynamic therapy, catalysis-conferred GSH depletion, and IR820-mediated sonodynamic therapy), Tf@IR820-DHA caused high levels of targeted ICD. This significantly increased the proportions of IFN-γ-secreting T cells (CD4+ T and CD8+ T) and enhanced a-PD-L1-mediated ICB against primary and distant tumors, which represents a promising approach for cancer nanoimmunotherapy.",ACS nano,2022,downloaded,10.1021/acsnano.1c08619.s001
34910856,Oxygen-Deficient BiOCl Combined with L-Buthionine-Sulfoximine Synergistically Suppresses Tumor Growth through Enhanced Singlet Oxygen Generation under Ultrasound Irradiation.,"Excess generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) based on sensitizers under ultrasound (US) excitation can cause the death of tumor cells via oxidative damage, but sonosensitizers are largely unexplored. Herein, oxygen-deficient black BiOCl (B-BiOCl) nanoplates (NPs) are reported, with post-treatment on conventional BiOCl by simple UV excitation, showing stronger singlet oxygen (1 O2 ) generation than commercial TiO2 nanoparticles and their derivatives under US irradiation. Moreover, L-buthionine-sulfoximine (BSO), a GSH biosynthesis inhibitor, is incorporated into B-BiOCl NPs. The authors find that BSO can be released owing to the degradation of B-BiOCl NPs in the presence of acid and GSH, which are overexpressed in tumors. The results show that BSO/B-BiOCl-PEG NPs have a multifunctional synergistic effect on improving ROS production. In particular, BiOCl has remarkable near-infrared light absorption after UV treatment and is good for photoacoustic imaging that can guide subsequent sonodynamic therapy. This work shows that just with a simple oxygen deficiency treatment, strong 1 O2 generation can be provided to a conventional material under US irradiation and, interestingly, this effect can be amplified by using a small inhibitor BSO, and this is clearly demonstrated in cell and mice experiments.","Small (Weinheim an der Bergstrasse, Germany)",2022,downloaded,10.1002/smll.202104550
34898184,Complementing Cancer Photodynamic Therapy with Ferroptosis through Iron Oxide Loaded Porphyrin-Grafted Lipid Nanoparticles.,"Nanomaterials that combine multimodality imaging and therapeutic functions within a single nanoplatform have drawn extensive attention for molecular medicines and biological applications. Herein, we report a theranostic nanoplatform based on a relatively smaller (<20 nm) iron oxide loaded porphyrin-grafted lipid nanoparticles (Fe3O4@PGL NPs). The amphiphilic PGL easily self-assembled on the hydrophobic exterior surface of ultrasmall Fe3O4 NPs, resulting in a final ultrasmall Fe3O4@PGL NPs with diameter of ∼10 nm. The excellent self-assembling nature of the as-synthesized PGL NPs facilitated a higher loading of porphyrins, showed a negligible dark toxicity, and demonstrated an excellent photodynamic effect against HT-29 cancer cells in vitro. The in vivo experimental results further confirmed that Fe3O4@PGL NPs were ideally qualified for both the fluorescence and magnetic resonance (MR) imaging guided nanoplatforms to track the biodistribution and therapeutic responses of NPs as well as to simultaneously trigger the generation of highly cytotoxic reactive oxygen species (ROS) necessary for excellent photodynamic therapy (PDT). After recording convincing therapeutic responses, we further evaluated the ability of Fe3O4@PGL NPs/Fe3O4@Lipid NPs for ferroptosis therapy (FT) via tumor microenvironment (TME) modulation for improved anticancer activity. We hypothesized that tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) could significantly improve the efficacy of FT by accelerating the Fenton reaction in vitro. In our results, the Fe ions released in vitro directly contributed to the Fenton reaction, whereas the presence of RAW 264.7 macrophages further accelerated the ROS generation as observed by the fluorescence imaging. The significant increase in the ROS during the coincubation of NPs, endocytosed by HT-29 cells and RAW264.7 cells, further induced increased cellular toxicity of cancer cells.",ACS nano,2021,downloaded,10.1021/acsnano.1c08108.s001
34787379,Photosynthetic Oxygenation-Augmented Sonodynamic Nanotherapy of Hypoxic Tumors.,"Reactive oxygen species (ROS) has been employed as a powerful therapeutic agent for eradicating tumor via oxidative stress. As an emerging ROS-involving noninvasive anticancer therapeutic modality, sonodynamic therapy (SDT) with high tissue penetration depth and benign remote spatiotemporal selectivity has been progressively utilized as the distinct alternative for ROS-based tumor treatment. However, the hypoxic tumor microenvironment substantially restricts the sonodynamic effect. In this work, an oxygen self-sufficient hybrid sonosensitizer on the basis of photosynthetic microorganisms cyanobacteria (Cyan) integrated with ultrasmall oxygen-deficient bimetallic oxide Mn1.4 WOx nanosonosensitizers, termed as M@C, is designed and engineered to overcome the critical issue of hypoxia-induced tumor resistance and strengthen the SDT effect. The sustained photosynthetic oxygen production by Cyan under light illumination can promote Mn1.4 WOx nanosonosensitizers to produce more ROS against cancer cells both in vitro and in vivo under ultrasound (US) irradiation. Especially, the sustained oxygen evolution for suppressing the gene expression of hypoxia-inducible factor 1alpha (HIF-1α) further boosts and augments the SDT efficiency. Thus, this work provides the paradigm that the rationally engineered biohybrid microorganism-based multifunctional sonosensitizers can serve as an effective bioplatform for augmenting the therapeutic efficiency of SDT, particularly for the treatment of hypoxic tumors.",Advanced healthcare materials,2022,downloaded,10.1002/adhm.202102135
34601197,Versatile metal-phenolic network nanoparticles for multitargeted combination therapy and magnetic resonance tracing in glioblastoma.,"Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is a common malignancy of the central nervous system, but conventional treatments yield unsatisfactory results. Although innovative therapeutic approaches have been developed, they prolong survival by only approximately 5 months. The heterogeneity of GBM renders growth inhibition with a single drug difficult, and exploring combination approaches with multiple targets for the comprehensive treatment of GBM is expected to overcome this limitation. In this study, we designed a biocompatible cRGD/Pt + DOX@GFNPs (RPDGs) nanoformulation to disrupt redox homeostasis in GBM cells and promote the simultaneous occurrence of efficient apoptosis and ferroptosis. Taking advantage of the highly stable Fenton reaction catalytic activity of gallic acid (GA)/Fe2+ nanoparticles in physiological environments, the ability of Pt (IV) to deplete glutathione (GSH) and increase reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels, and the efficient photothermal conversion efficiency of GA/Fe2+ nanoparticles, our synthesized multifunctional and multitargeted RPDGs significantly increased intracellular ROS levels and thus induced ferroptosis. Furthermore, the RPDGs displayed superior photothermal responsiveness and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) capabilities. These results indicate that RPDGs can not only directly inhibit the growth of tumors but also effectively improve the efficient translocation of conventional chemotherapeutic drugs across the blood-brain barrier, thereby providing a new approach for the comprehensive treatment of GBM.",Biomaterials,2021,downloaded,10.1016/j.biomaterials.2021.121163
34536041,Sono-Controllable and ROS-Sensitive CRISPR-Cas9 Genome Editing for Augmented/Synergistic Ultrasound Tumor Nanotherapy.,"The potential of the cluster regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat (CRISPR)-associated protein 9 (Cas9)-based therapeutic genome editing is severely hampered by the difficulties in precise regulation of the in vivo activity of the CRISPR-Cas9 system. Herein, sono-controllable and reactive oxygen species (ROS)-sensitive sonosensitizer-integrated metal-organic frameworks (MOFs), denoted as P/M@CasMTH1, are developed for augmented sonodynamic therapy (SDT) efficacy using the genome-editing technology. P/M@CasMTH1 nanoparticles comprise singlet oxygen (1 O2 )-generating MOF structures anchored with CRISPR-Cas9 systems via 1 O2 -cleavable linkers, which serve not only as a delivery vector of CRISPR-Cas9 targeting MTH1, but also as a sonoregulator to spatiotemporally activate the genome editing. P/M@CasMTH1 escapes from the lysosomes, harvests the ultrasound (US) energy and converts it into abundant 1 O2 to induce SDT. The generated ROS subsequently trigger cleavage of ROS-responsive thioether bonds, thus inducing controllable release of the CRISPR-Cas9 system and initiation of genome editing. The genomic disruption of MTH1 conspicuously augments the therapeutic efficacy of SDT by destroying the self-defense system in tumor cells, thereby causing cellular apoptosis and tumor suppression. This therapeutic strategy for synergistic MTH1 disruption and abundant 1 O2 generation provides a paradigm for augmenting SDT efficacy based on the emerging nanomedicine-enabled genome-editing technology.","Advanced materials (Deerfield Beach, Fla.)",2021,downloaded,10.1002/adma.202104641
34533945,W-Doped TiO2 Nanorods for Multimode Tumor Eradication in Osteosarcoma Models under Single Ultrasound Irradiation.,"Sonosensitizers play crucial roles in the controlled production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) under ultrasound (US) irradiation with high tissue-penetration depth for noninvasive solid tumor therapy. It is desirable to fabricate structurally simple yet multifunctional sonosensitizers from ultrafine nanoparticles for ROS-based multimode therapy to overcome monomode limitations such as low ROS production yields and endogenous reductive glutathione (GSH) to ROS-based treatment resistance. We report the facile high-temperature solution synthesis of ultrafine W-doped TiO2 (W-TiO2) nanorods for exploration of their sonodynamic, chemodynamic, and GSH-depleting activities in sonodynamic-chemodynamic combination tumor therapy. We found that W5+ and W6+ ions doped in W-TiO2 nanorods play multiple roles in enhancing their ROS production. First, W doping narrows the band gap from 3.2 to 2.3 eV and introduces oxygen and Ti vacancies for enhancing their sonodynamic performance. Second, W5+ doping endows W-TiO2 nanorods with Fenton-like reaction activity to produce •OH from endogenous H2O2 in the tumor. Third, W6+ ions reduce endogenous GSH to glutathione disulfide (GSSG) and, in turn, form W5+ ions that further enhance their chemodynamic activity, which greatly modifies thae oxidation-reduction tumor microenvironment in the tumor. In vivo experiments display the excellent ability of W-TiO2 nanorods for enhanced tumor eradication in human osteosarcoma models under single US irradiation. Importantly, the ultrafine nanorod morphology facilitates rapid excretion from the body, displaying no significant systemic toxicity. Our work suggests that multivalent metal doping in ultrafine nanomaterials is an effective and simple strategy for the introduction of new functions for ROS-based multimode therapy.",ACS applied materials & interfaces,2021,downloaded,10.1021/acsami.1c14701.s001
34533177,Cetuximab-Ag2S quantum dots for fluorescence imaging and highly effective combination of ALA-based photodynamic/chemo-therapy of colorectal cancer cells.,"Colorectal cancer (CRC) has a poor prognosis and urgently needs better therapeutic approaches. 5-Aminolevulinic acid (ALA) induced protoporphyrin IX (PpIX) based photodynamic therapy (PDT) is already used in the clinic for several cancers but not yet well investigated for CRC. Currently, systemic administration of ALA offers a limited degree of tumour selectivity, except for intracranial tumours, limiting its wider use in the clinic. The combination of effective ALA-PDT and chemotherapy may provide a promising alternative approach for CRC treatment. Herein, theranostic Ag2S quantum dots (AS-2MPA) optically trackable in near-infrared (NIR), conjugated with endothelial growth factor receptor (EGFR) targeting Cetuximab (Cet) and loaded with ALA for PDT monotherapy or ALA/5-fluorouracil (5FU) for the combination therapy are proposed for enhanced treatment of EGFR(+) CRC. AS-2MPA-Cet exhibited excellent targeting of the high EGFR expressing cells and showed a strong intracellular signal for NIR optical detection in a comparative study performed on SW480, HCT116, and HT29 cells, which exhibit high, medium and low EGFR expression, respectively. Targeting provided enhanced uptake of the ALA loaded nanoparticles by strong EGFR expressing cells and formation of higher levels of PpIX. Cells also differ in their efficiency to convert ALA to PpIX, and SW480 was the best, followed by HT29, while HCT116 was determined as unsuitable for ALA-PDT. The therapeutic efficacy was evaluated in 2D cell cultures and 3D spheroids of SW480 and HT29 cells using AS-2MPA with either electrostatically loaded, hydrazone or amide linked ALA to achieve different levels of pH or enzyme sensitive release. Most effective phototoxicity was observed in SW480 cells using AS-2MPA-ALA-electrostatic-Cet due to enhanced uptake of the particles, fast ALA release and effective ALA-to-PpIX conversion. Targeted delivery reduced the effective ALA concentration significantly which was further reduced with codelivery of 5FU. Delivery of ALA via covalent linkages was also effective for PDT, but required a longer incubation time for the release of ALA in therapeutic doses. Phototoxicity was correlated with high levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and apoptotic/necrotic cell death. Hence, both AS-2MPA-ALA-Cet based PDT and AS-2MPA-ALA-Cet-5FU based chemo/PDT combination therapy coupled with strong NIR tracking of the nanoparticles demonstrate an exceptional therapeutic effect on CRC cells and excellent potential for synergistic multistage tumour targeting therapy.",Nanoscale,2021,downloaded,10.1039/d1nr03507j
34477686,Multifunctional nanozyme for multimodal imaging-guided enhanced sonodynamic therapy by regulating the tumor microenvironment.,"Sonodynamic therapy (SDT) is a highly promising approach for cancer therapy, but its efficacy is severely hampered by the low specificity of sonosensitizers and the unfavorable characteristics of the tumor microenvironment (TME), such as hypoxia and glutathione (GSH) overexpression. To solve these problems, in this work, we encapsulated IR780 and MnO2 in PLGA and linked Angiopep-2 (Ang) to synthesize a multifunctional nanozyme (Ang-IR780-MnO2-PLGA, AIMP) to enhance SDT. With Ang functionalization to facilitate blood-brain barrier (BBB) penetration and glioma targeting, and through the function of IR780, these nanoparticles (NPs) showed improved targeting of cancer cells, especially mitochondria, and spread deep into tumor centers. Upon low-intensity focused ultrasound (LIFU) irradiation, reactive oxygen species (ROS) were produced and induced tumor cell apoptosis. Combined with the specific mitochondria-targeting ability of IR780, the sonodynamic effects were amplified because mitochondria are sensitive to ROS. In addition, MnO2 exhibited enzyme-like activity, reacting with the high levels of hydrogen protons (H+), H2O2 and GSH in the TME to continuously produce oxygen and consume GSH, which further enhanced the effect of SDT. Moreover, Mn2+ can be released in response to TME stimulation and used as a magnetic resonance (MR) contrast agent. In addition, IR780 has photoacoustic (PA)/fluorescence (FL) imaging capabilities. Our results demonstrated that AIMP NPs subjected to LIFU triggering maximally enhanced the therapeutic effect of SDT by multiple mechanisms, including multiple targeting, deep penetration, oxygen supply in situ and GSH depletion, thereby significantly inhibiting tumor growth and distal metastasis without systemic toxicity. In summary, this multifunctional nanozyme provides a promising strategy for cancer diagnosis and treatment under the intelligent guidance of multimodal imaging (PA/FL/MR) and may be a safe clinical translational method.",Nanoscale,2021,downloaded,10.1039/d1nr01449h

Here, a multifunctional nanoplatform composed of MoO3-x nanosheets, Ag nanocubes, and MnO2 nanoparticles was developed to overcome these drawbacks. For this nanoplatform, hyperthermia and reactive oxygen species (ROS) were simultaneously generated under single 808 nm near-infrared (NIR) light irradiation. Once this nanoplatform accumulated in the tumor region, GSH was depleted by MnO2 and intracellular H2O2 was catalyzed by MnO2 to produce O2 to relieve hypoxia. Ultrasound (US) imaging confirmed in-situ O2 generation. Magnetic resonance (MR) imaging, photoacoustic (PA) imaging, and fluorescence imaging were used to monitor in vivo biodistribution of nanomaterials. This provides a paradigm to rationally design a single NIR laser induced multimodal imaging-guided efficient PDT/PTT cancer strategy.",Journal of controlled release : official journal of the Controlled Release Society,2021,downloaded,10.1016/j.jconrel.2021.08.022
34363332,Sub 5 nm Gd3+ -Hemoporfin Framework Nanodots for Augmented Sonodynamic Theranostics and Fast Renal Clearance.,"Metal-organic nanomaterials have emerged as promising therapeutic agents to produce reactive oxygen species (ROS) under ultrasound (US) or light irradiation for tumor treatments. However, their relatively large sizes (ranging from tens to hundreds of nanometers) usually lead to low ROS utilization and body metabolism, thus enlarging their long-term toxicity and low therapeutic effect. To solve these shortcomings, herein the ultrasmall Gd3+ -hemoporfin framework nanodots (GdHF-NDs， ≈5 nm) is reported as efficient nano-sonosensitizers. Compared with GdHF aggregation (GdHF-A, ≈400 nm), the ultrasmall GdHF-NDs generate 2.3-fold toxic ROS amount under similar conditions, due to shorter diffusion path and larger relative specific surface area. When the GdHF-NDs dispersion is introvenously injected into tumor-bearing mouse, they are accumulated within tumors to provide high magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) contrast. Under US irradiation, the GdHF-NDs achieve a better sonodynamic therapeutic efficacy for tumors, compared with that from GdHF-A. More importantly, owing to ultrasmall size, most of GdHF-NDs can be rapidly cleared through the renal pathway. Therefore, GdHF-NDs can be used as a biosafety and high-performance sonodynamic agent for cancer theranostics.",Advanced healthcare materials,2021,downloaded,10.1002/adhm.202100703
34274778,Nanoengineered biomimetic Cu-based nanoparticles for multifunational and efficient tumor treatment.,"The microwave dynamic therapy (MDT) mediated by cytotoxic reactive oxygen species (ROS) is a promising anticancer therapeutic method. However, the therapeutic efficiency of MDT is restricted by several limitations including insufficient ROS generation, strong proangiogenic response, and low tumor-targeting efficiency. Herein, we find that Cu-based nanoparticles can produce oxygen under microwave (MW) irradiation to raise the generation of ROS, such as •O2, •OH and 1O2, especially •O2. On this basis, a nanoengineered biomimetic strategy is designed to improve the efficiency of MDT. After intravenous administration, the nanoparticles accumulate to the tumor site through targeting effect mediated by biomimetic modification, and it can continuously produce oxygen to raise the levels of ROS in tumor microenvironment under MW irradiation for MDT. Additionally, Apatinib is incorporated as antiangiogenic drug to downregulate the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), which can effectively inhibit the tumor angiogenesis after MDT. Hence, the tumor inhibition rate is as high as 96.79%.

34232622,Homology and Immune Checkpoint Dual-Targeted Sonocatalytic Nanoagents for Enhancing Sonodynamic Tumor Therapy.,"Sonocatalytic nanoagents (SCNs), a kind of sonosensitizers, could catalyze oxygen to generate abundant reactive oxygen species (ROS) under stimulations of noninvasive and deep-penetrating ultrasound (US), which is commonly used for sonodynamic therapy (SDT) of tumors such as malignant melanoma. However, poor bioavailability of most SCNs and fast quenching of extracellular-generating ROS from SDT limit further applications of SCNs in the SDT of tumors. Herein, we synthesized a new kind of TiO2-based SCN functionalized with the malignant melanoma cell membrane (B16F10M) and programmed cell death-ligand 1 antibody (aPD-L1) for homology and immune checkpoint dual-targeted and enhanced sonodynamic tumor therapy. Under US irradiation, the synthesized SCN can catalytically generate a large amount of 1O2. In vitro experiments validate that functionalized SCNs exhibit precise targeting effects, high tumor cell uptake, and intracellular sonocatalytic killing of the B16F10 cells by a large amount of localized ROS. Utilizing the melanoma animal model, the functionalized SCN displays visible long-term retention in the tumor area, which assists the homology and immune checkpoint synergistically dual-targeted and enhanced in vivo SDT of the tumor. We suggest that this highly bioavailable and dual-functionalized SCN may provide a promising strategy and nanoplatform for enhancing sonodynamic tumor therapies.",ACS applied materials & interfaces,2021,downloaded,10.1021/acsami.1c08105.s001
34190424,Versatile Nanodrugs Containing Glutathione and Heme Oxygenase 1 Inhibitors Enable Suppression of Antioxidant Defense System in a Two-Pronged Manner for Enhanced Photodynamic Therapy.,"The antioxidant defense system in malignant cells, which involves antioxidant enzymes and antioxidant molecules, is an innate barrier to photodynamic therapy (PDT). Because of the complexity of the endogenous antioxidant mechanisms of these cells, simply inhibiting individual antioxidant pathways has a limited effect on improving the lethality of ROS. To enhance the efficacy of PDT for tumor treatment, a versatile nanoparticle (NP)-based drug is developed, which the authors call PZB NP, containing the glutathione inhibitor l-buthionine sulfoximine (BSO) and the heme oxygenase 1 (HO-1) inhibitor protoporphyrin zinc(II) (ZnPP) to suppress the innate antioxidant defense system of cancer cells in a two-pronged manner. BSO reduces intracellular glutathione levels to minimize ROS elimination and protein protection during PDT, and ZnPP inhibits the ROS-stimulated upregulation of the antioxidant HO-1, thus preventing ROS removal by cells after PDT. Thus, BSO and ZnPP synergistically suppress the antioxidant defense systems of cancer cells both during and after protoporphyrin-IX-mediated PDT in a two-pronged manner, resulting in tumor cell death through excess oxidative pressure. The results demonstrate that the construction of nanodrugs having dual antioxidation defense suppression properties is a promising route for the development of highly efficient ROS-based therapies.",Advanced healthcare materials,2021,downloaded,10.1002/adhm.202100770
34180675,Ultrasmall Barium Titanate Nanoparticles for Highly Efficient Hypoxic Tumor Therapy via Ultrasound Triggered Piezocatalysis and Water Splitting.,"Hypoxia in a solid tumor microenvironment (TME) can lead to the overexpression of hypoxia-inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α), which correlates to tumor metastasis. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) induced tumor cell apoptosis is becoming a promising method in tumor treatment. Currently, the ROS generating systems, e.g., photodynamic treatment and sonodynamic treatment, highly depend on oxygen (O2) in the tumor microenvironment (TME). However, the level of O2 in TME is too low to produce enough ROS. Herein, we developed an ultrasmall DSPE-PEG2000 coated barium titanate nanoparticle (P-BTO) for tumor treatment based on ultrasound triggered piezocatalysis and water splitting. Interestingly, irradiated by ultrasound, the surface of ultasmall P-BTO nanoparticles produced imbalance charges, which induced a cascade of redox reaction processes to simultaneously generate ROS and O2, the latter one was hardly generated in large-sized barium titanate nanoparticles. The as-synthesized P-BTO reached the highest accumulation in the tumor site at 4 h after intravenous injection. The results showed that the produced O2 significantly alleviated the hypoxia of TME to down-regulate the expression of HIF-1α, and the produced ROS can efficiently kill tumor cells. Moreover, the tumor metastasis was also inhibited, providing a different way to treat triple-negative breast cancer, which was easily metastatic and lacked effective treatments in the clinic.",ACS nano,2021,downloaded,10.1021/acsnano.1c00616.s001
34160201,Upconverted Metal-Organic Framework Janus Architecture for Near-Infrared and Ultrasound Co-Enhanced High Performance Tumor Therapy.,"Strict conditions such as hypoxia, overexpression of glutathione (GSH), and high concentration of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) in the tumor microenvironment (TME) limit the therapeutic effects of reactive oxygen species (ROS) for photodynamic therapy (PDT), chemodynamic therapy (CDT), and sonodynamic therapy (SDT). Here we fabricated a biocatalytic Janus nanocomposite (denoted as UPFB) for ultrasound (US) driven SDT and 808 nm near-infrared (NIR) light mediated PDT by combining core-shell-shell upconversion nanoparticles (UCNPs, NaYF4:20%Yb,1%Tm@NaYF4:10%Yb@NaNdF4) and a ferric zirconium porphyrin metal organic framework [PCN-224(Fe)]. Our design not only substantially overcomes the inefficient PDT effect arising from the inadequate Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET) process from UCNPs (donor) to MOFs (acceptor) with only NIR laser irradiation, but also promotes the ROS generation via GSH depletion and oxygen supply contributed by Fe3+ ions coordinated in UPFB as a catalase-like nanozyme. Additionally, the converted Fe2+ from the foregoing process can achieve CDT performance under acidic conditions, such as lysosomes. Meanwhile, UPFB linked with biotin exhibits a good targeting ability to rapidly accumulate in the tumor region, verified by fluorescence imaging and T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). In a word, it is believed that the synthesis and antitumor detection of UPFB heterostructures render them suitable for application in cancer therapeutics.",ACS nano,2021,downloaded,10.1021/acsnano.1c04280

However, the clinical efficacy of HIFU in combination chemotherapy is often impeded by the pre-existing hypoxia tumor microenvironment-induced multidrug resistance (MDR). Therefore, it is imperative for HIFU combined with chemotherapy to overcome MDR by improving the tumor hypoxic microenvironment. Hence, we developed highly stable nanoparticles (P@BDOX/β-lapachone-NO-NPs) with intracellular nitric oxide (NO)- and reactive oxygen species (ROS)-generating capabilities at the tumor site to relieve the hypoxic tumor microenvironment in solid tumors. Doxorubicin prodrug (boronate-DOX, BDOX) and β-lapachone were concurrently loaded onto actively targeted pH (low) insertion peptides (pHLIPs)-poly(ethylene glycol) and nitrated gluconic acid copolymers. Our results showed that the ability of P@BDOX/β-lapachone-NO-NPs to generate NO and ROS simultaneously is vital for the sensitization of hypoxic solid tumors for chemotherapy, as evidenced by the suppression of tumor cells and tissues (in vitro and in the nude mice model). Thus, this combined therapy holds considerable potential in the management of hypoxic solid tumors.",ACS applied materials & interfaces,2021,downloaded,10.1021/acsami.1c07494
34062419,A hypoxia responsive nanoassembly for tumor specific oxygenation and enhanced sonodynamic therapy.,"The hypoxic tumor microenvironment (TME) and non-specific distribution of sonosensitizers are two major obstacles that limit practical applications of sonodynamic therapy (SDT) in combating tumors. Here we report a hypoxia-responsive nanovesicle (hMVs) as delivery vehicles of a sonosensitizer to enhance the efficacy of SDT via specific payload release and local oxygenation in the tumor. The nanovesicles are composed of densely packed manganese ferrite nanoparticles (MFNs) embedded in hypoxia-responsive amphiphilic polymer membranes. With δ-aminolevulinic acid (ALA) loaded in the hollow cavities, the hMVs could rapidly dissociate into discrete nanoparticles in the hypoxic TME to release the payload and induce the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) under ultrasound (US) radiation. Meanwhile, the released MFNs could catalytically generate O2 to overcome the hypoxic TME and thus enhance the efficacy of SDT. After treatment, the dissociated MFNs could be readily excreted from the body via renal clearance to reduce long term toxicity.

34033477,Safe and Targeted Sonodynamic Cancer Therapy Using Biocompatible Exosome-Based Nanosonosensitizers.,"Sonodynamic therapy (SDT), wherein sonosensitizers irradiated with ultrasound (US) produce cytotoxic reactive oxygen species (ROS), has garnered great attention as a promising alternative to photodynamic therapy owing to the significantly increased depth of tissue penetration. The development of nanocarriers that can selectively deposit sonosensitizers into tumor tissues without systemic toxicity is crucial to facilitate the translation of SDT to clinical use. In this study, exosomes, a class of naturally occurring nanoparticles, were utilized as nanocarriers for safe and cancer-targeted delivery of a sonosensitizer, indocyanine green (ICG). The exosomes were surface-engineered with an active cancer-targeting ligand, folic acid (FA), to increase the cancer specificity of the ICG-loaded exosomes (ExoICG). The FA-conjugated, ICG-loaded exosomes (FA-ExoICG) greatly improved aqueous stability and cellular uptake of ICG, resulting in significantly increased ROS generation in breast cancer cells. As a result, the FA-ExoICG demonstrated greater sonotoxicity against cancer cells than ExoICG and free ICG. The in vivo study revealed that compared to ExoICG, more FA-ExoICG accumulated in tumors, and their pharmacokinetic properties were superior. Notably, tumor growth in mice was significantly suppressed, without systemic toxicity, by a single intravenous injection of the FA-ExoICG and subsequent US irradiation. Therefore, this study demonstrated that active cancer-targeted FA-ExoICG could serve as effective nanosonosensitizers for safe and targeted cancer treatment.",ACS applied materials & interfaces,2021,downloaded,10.1021/acsami.0c22883.s001

These AIE luminogens (AIEgens) exhibit long emission wavelengths, good photostability, remarkable biocompatibility, good reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation performance and excellent photothermal conversion efficiency, which allow them to be powerfully utilized for in vitro and in vivo cancer phototheranostics. The results show that one of the AIEgens is capable of precisely diagnosing solid tumors of mice by means of combined near-infrared-I/II (NIR-I/II) fluorescence-photoacoustic imaging, meanwhile this AIEgen can activate photodynamic and photothermal synergistic therapy (PDT-PTT) upon laser irradiation, resulting in excellent tumor elimination efficacy with only once injection and irradiation.

However, its biomedical applications, especially in antitumor therapeutics, have been seldom investigated to date. Here, oxygen-deficient zirconia (ZrO2-x)-based nanoplatform with surface PEGylation and cyclic-Arg-Gly-Asp (cRGD) peptide functionalization (ZrO2-x@PEG/cRGD, abbreviated as ZPR) was rationally designed and established for the first time, which was utilized as therapy-activated ""immunogenic cell death (ICD)"" inducer to boost photothermal-augmented sonodynamic tumor elimination in NIR-II biological window. As-synthesized ZPR nanoparticles (NPs) exhibited intense optical absorbance in the wavelength range of 900-1100 nm, which endowed ZPR NPs with a photothermal conversion efficiency as high as 45.8% for photothermal therapy (PTT). Moreover, owing to the abundant surface oxygen defects, ZPR NPs can serve as a category of high-performance nano-sonosensitizer based on the strengthened separation of electron (e-)/hole (h+) pairs from the energy band under external ultrasound (US) activation. More importantly, cytotoxic reactive oxygen species (ROS) generated from sonodynamic therapy (SDT) can effectively induce immunogenic cell death (ICD), which is regarded to be significant to boost systemic anti-tumor immunity for rendering a complete tumor eradication post-treatment. In vivo experiments on tumor xenografts demonstrated the high therapeutic efficacy upon photothermal-augmented sonodynamic therapy, with the aid of photoacoustic (PA) imaging navigation. Remarkably, the level of inflammatory cytokines, including type I interferon (IFN), tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α) as well as interleukin (IL-6) were systemically upgraded after NIR-II/US irradiation, verifying the promotion of immunogenicity. Taken together, this study delivers useful insights for extending the applications of zirconia as promising translational medicine for tumor theranostics in the near future.",Biomaterials,2021,downloaded,10.1016/j.biomaterials.2021.120787
33797161,Transformable Nanosensitizer with Tumor Microenvironment-Activated Sonodynamic Process and Calcium Release for Enhanced Cancer Immunotherapy.,"Despite the promise of sonodynamic processes in cancer therapy, existing sonosensitizers often fail to regulate the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) against tumors, potentially leading to off-target toxicity to normal tissues. We report a transformable core-shell nanosonosensitizer (TiO2 @CaP) that reinvigorates ROS generation and dissolves its CaP shell to release Ca2+ in an acidic tumor microenvironment (TME) under ultrasound activation. Thus, TiO2 @CaP acts as a smart nanosonosensitizer that specifically induces mitochondrial dysfunction via overloading intracellular Ca2+ ions to synergize with the sonodynamic process in the TME. TiO2 @CaP substantially enhances immunogenic cell death, resulting in enhanced T-cell recruitment and infiltration into the immunogenic cold tumor (4T1). In conjunction with checkpoint blockade therapy (anti-PD 1), TiO2 @CaP-mediated sonodynamic therapy elicits systemic antitumor immunity, leading to regression of non-treated distant tumors and inhibition of lung metastasis.

33645960,Hetero-Core-Shell BiNS-Fe@Fe as a Potential Theranostic Nanoplatform for Multimodal Imaging-Guided Simultaneous Photothermal-Photodynamic and Chemodynamic Treatment.,"Photothermal/photodynamic therapy (PTT/PDT) and synergistic therapeutic strategies are often sought after, owing to their low side effects and minimal invasiveness compared to chemotherapy and surgical treatments. However, in spite of the development of the most PTT/PDT materials with good tumor-inhibitory effect, there are some disadvantages of photosensitizers and photothermal agents, such as low stability and low photonic efficiency, which greatly limit their further application. Therefore, in this study, a novel bismuth-based hetero-core-shell semiconductor nanomaterial BiNS-Fe@Fe with good photonic stability and synergistic theranostic functions was designed. On the one hand, BiNS-Fe@Fe with a high atomic number exhibits good X-ray absorption, enhanced magnetic resonance (MR) T2-weighted imaging, and strong photoacoustic imaging (PAI) signals. In addition, the hetero-core-shell provides a strong barrier to decline the recombination of electron-hole pairs, inducing the generation of a large amount of reactive oxygen species (ROS) when irradiated with visible-NIR light. Meanwhile, a Fenton reaction can further increase ROS generation in the tumor microenvironment. Furthermore, an outstanding chemodynamic therapeutic potential was determined for this material. In particular, a high photothermal conversion efficiency (η = 37.9%) is of significance and could be achieved by manipulating surface decoration with Fe, which results in tumor ablation. In summary, BiNS-Fe@Fe could achieve remarkable utilization of ROS, high photothermal conversion law, and good chemodynamic activity, which highlight the multimodal theranostic potential strategies of tumors, providing a potential viewpoint for theranostic applications of tumors.",ACS applied materials & interfaces,2021,downloaded,10.1021/acsami.0c21579
33624647,Iron-based nanoparticles for MR imaging-guided ferroptosis in combination with photodynamic therapy to enhance cancer treatment.,"Ferroptosis therapy, which applies ferroptotic inducers to produce lethal lipid peroxidation and induce the death of tumor cells, is regarded as a promising therapeutic strategy for cancer treatment. However, there is still a challenge regarding how to increase reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation in the tumor microenvironment (TME) to enhance antitumor efficacy. Herein, we designed a nanosystem coated with the FDA approved poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) containing ferrous ferric oxide (Fe3O4) and chlorin E6 (Ce6) for synergistic ferroptosis-photodynamic anticancer therapy. The Fe3O4-PLGA-Ce6 nanosystem can dissociate in the acidic TME to release ferrous/ferric ions and Ce6. Then, the Fenton reaction between the released ferrous/ferric ions and intracellular excess hydrogen peroxide can occur to produce hydroxyl radicals (˙OH) and induce tumor cell ferroptosis. The released Ce6 can increase the generation and accumulation of ROS under laser irradiation to offer photodynamic therapy, which can boost ferroptosis in 4T1 cells. Moreover, magnetic monodisperse Fe3O4 loading provides excellent T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) properties. The Fe3O4-PLGA-Ce6 nanosystem possesses MRI ability and highly efficient tumor suppression with high biocompatibility in vivo due to the synergism of photodynamic and ferroptosis antitumor therapies.",Nanoscale,2021,downloaded,10.1039/d0nr08757b

Reactive oxygen species (ROS)-based therapy is practically destroyed by the high concentration of glutathione (GSH) inside tumors, and depleting GSH to improve the outcome of SDT is indeed a great challenge. Herein, we designed GSH-depleting nanoplatelets for enhanced sonodynamic cancer therapy. A platelet membrane coated nanosystem (PSCI) has been designed and tested comprising mesoporous silica nanoparticles (MSNs) which have been loaded with cinnamaldehyde (CA) as an oxidative stress amplifier. The inner layer comprises the sonosensitizer IR780 and the oxidative stress amplifier CA, whereas the platelet membranes (PM) were designed and utilized as an outer layer that can target tumors, thereby enhancing the effectiveness of SDT by attenuating the capability of tumor cells for scavenging ROS with GSH. SDT and cinnamaldehyde amplify oxidative stress by acting synergistically, leading to the preferential destruction of cancer cells in vitro and in vivo.

However, Fenton-based CDT is severely impaired by the inappropriate tumor environment associated with undesirable intratumoral acidity and insufficient H2O2 supply in tumor microenvironment (TME). Therefore, a strategy that can address these concerns is highly desired and beneficial for boosting such treatment. Herein, a magnetic nanoreactor system (denoted as poly (lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA)-superparamagnetic iron oxide (SPIO)&vitamin C (Vc) was constructed with Vc in the core, SPIO on the shell, and PLGA as the building carrier. Upon low-intensity focused ultrasound irradiation, on-demand Vc release can locally decompose into H2O2, which can generate a favorable condition for facilitating SPIO-based Fenton-like reaction and result in continuous O2 and OH/1O2 generation. The TME modulation-augmented CDT by this nanoreactor based on the reinforced Fenton reaction tremendously improved the antitumor outcomes, especially under increased accumulation contributed by magnetic targeting combined with enhanced permeability and retention effect. Moreover, the explosive production of oxygen can be monitored by real-time photoacoustic imaging, offering a noninvasive means to forecast the treatment efficacy. Therefore, this established microenvironment modulation strategy for augmenting Fenton reaction-based CDT paves a new avenue to realize highly efficient cancer theranostics.",Biomaterials,2021,downloaded,10.1016/j.biomaterials.2021.120710

However, the anticancer effects are greatly limited by the strong acidity requirements for effective Fenton-like reaction, and the inevitably ""off-target"" toxicity. Herein, we develop an acidity-unlocked nanoplatform (FePt@FeOx @TAM-PEG) that can accurately perform the high-efficient and tumor-specific catalysis for anticancer treatment, through dual pathway of cyclic amplification strategy. Notably, the pH-responsive peculiarity of tamoxifen (TAM) drug allows for the catalytic activity of FePt@FeOx to be ""turn-on"" in acidic tumor microenvironments, while keeping silence in neutral condition. Importantly, the released TAM within cancer cells is able to inhibit mitochondrial complex I, leading to the upregulated lactate content and thereby the accumulated intracellular H+ , which can overcome the intrinsically insufficient acidity of tumor. Through the positive feedback loop, large amount of active FePt@FeOx nanocatalyzers are released and able to access to the endogenous H2 O2 , exerting the improved Fenton-like reaction within the more acidic condition. Finally, such smart nanoplatform enables self-boosting generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and induces strong intracellular oxidative stress, leading to the substantial anticancer outcomes in vivo, which may provide a new insight for tumor-specific cascade catalytic therapy and reducing the ""off-target"" toxicity to surrounding normal tissues.",Angewandte Chemie (International ed. in English),2021,downloaded,10.1002/ange.202014415

However, most theranostic agents were fabricated by chemically coupling two or more independent functional units with diagnostic or therapeutic capabilities, and therefore have a large size. To date, one-step synthesis of unmodified ultrasmall quantum dots (QDs) integrating CDT and fluorescence imaging capabilities remains a challenge. Herein, we reported a simple one-step synthesis method of ultrasmall (2.46 nm) Zn-doped Cu2S (Zn:Cu2S) QDs with inherent properties of both high CDT activity and near-infrared fluorescence imaging capability. The fluorescence of Cu2S QDs was significantly enhanced approximately tenfold after Zn doping due to the compensation of defects. In vitro and in vivo experiments demonstrated that the Zn:Cu2S QDs could specifically and significantly inhibit the cancer cell growth (inhibition rate exceeded 65%) without damaging the normal cells. Furthermore, the CDT mechanism study suggested that a Fenton-like reaction occurred after the Zn:Cu2S QDs entered the tumor cells, inducing apoptosis via the mitochondrial signaling pathway, and activating the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and autophagy to selectively eliminate tumor cells to achieve CDT. This work proposed a simple one-step synthesis of unmodified ultrasmall QDs with fluorescence imaging and CDT, which provides a promising strategy for QDs to act as multi-functional theranostic agents.",Nanoscale,2021,downloaded,10.1039/d0nr07537j

In addition, we discovered that such SnNSs could also serve as robust near-infrared (NIR)-mediated photothermal therapy (PTT) agents owing to their efficient photothermal conversion, and serve as nanocarriers for anticancer drug delivery owing to the inherent 2D layered structure.

The oxi-redox activity is related to the type and presence of surface defects, which is modified with appropriate synthesis conditions. In the present work, we used MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 human breast cancer cells and nonmalignant MCF-10A human breast cells to demonstrate how controlled oxidative stress mediated by specifically nanoengineered indium tin oxide (ITO) NPs can selectively induce cell death in the cancer cells while reducing the oxidative stress in the normal cells and supporting their proliferation. The ITO NPs are also promising nanotheranostic materials for cancer therapy and contrast agents because of their multimodal imaging capabilities. We demonstrate that the synthesized ITO NPs can selectively increase the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in both breast tumor cell lines, resulting in activation of apoptosis, and can also greatly suppress the cellular proliferation in both types of tumor cells. In contrast, the ITO NPs exhibit ROS scavenging-like behavior, significantly decreasing the ROS levels in MCF-10A cells exposed to the additional ROS, hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), so that they protect the proliferation of nonmalignant MCF-10A cells from ROS damage. In addition, fluorescent microscopy images revealed that the ITO NPs emit strong fluorescence that could be used to reveal their location. Moreover, computed tomography imaging demonstrated that the ITO NPs exhibited a comparable capability toward anatomical contrast enhancement. These results suggest that the synthesized ITO NPs have the potential to be a novel selective therapeutic agent with a multimodal imaging property for anticancer treatment.",ACS applied materials & interfaces,2021,downloaded,10.1021/acsami.0c17326.s001

Herein, a biodegradable hollow SiO2-based nanosystem (Ag2S-GOx@BHS NYs) is developed by a novel one-step dual-template (bovine serum albumin (BSA) and cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB)) synthetic strategy for image-guided therapy. The Ag2S-GOx@BHS NYs can be specifically activated in the tumor microenvironment via a self-feedback mechanism to achieve reactive oxygen species (ROS)-induced multistep therapy. In response to the inherent acidity and H2O2 at the tumor sites, Ag2S-GOx@BHS would accelerate the structural degradation while releasing glucose oxidase (GOx), which could efficiently deplete intratumoral glucose to copious amounts of gluconic acid and H2O2. More importantly, the sufficient H2O2 not only acts as a reactant to generate Ag+ from Ag2S for metal-ion therapy and improves the oxidative stress but also combines with gluconic acid results in the self-accelerating degradation process. Moreover, the released Ag2S nanoparticles can help the Ag2S-GOx@BHS NYs realize the second near-infrared window fluorescence (NIR-II FL) and photoacoustic (PA) imaging-guided precise photothermal therapy (PTT).

Herein, we synthesized multifunctional tumor-targeted poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) nanoparticles (NPs-cRGD) for monitoring therapeutic effects by dual-mode imaging and overcoming cisplatin resistance. Uniformly sized NPs-cRGD demonstrated controlled and sustained release of drugs and genes, excellent gene loading and gene protection capacity, good storage stability and no serum-induced aggregation in vitro. NPs-cRGD demonstrated clear, targeting and prolonged ultrasound imaging and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in vivo. The targeting of NPs-cRGD combined with ultrasound facilitated nanoparticle penetrattion into cells; entry was time-dependent. NPs-cRGD escaped from lysosomes, thereby preventing siBIRC5 degradation, which enabled siBIRC5 to efficiently inhibit the antiapoptosis effects of BIRC5 in SKO3-DDP to overcome the antiapoptosis properties of resistant cells. Furthermore, Pt(IV) in NPs-cRGD exhausted glutathione (GSH), thereby increasing drug accumulation to effectively increase Pt(II) levels. The subsequent combination of Pt(II) with DNA prevented the expressions of genes and upregulated the expression of p53 to induce the mitochondria apoptosis pathway. The reduced GSH activity and the generation of Pt(II) further promoted high levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) to induce cell apoptosis. Therefore, NPs-cRGD with ultrasound promoted the apoptosis of resistant ovarian cancer cells by multiple mechanisms, including increased cellular drug accumulation, reversed antiapoptotic effects by siBIRC5, and enhanced ROS levels. In a tumor-bearing nude mice model, NPs-cRGD with US demonstrated excellent tumor-targeting, high efficiency tumor inhibition and low systemic toxicity. Therefore, NPs-cRGD provides a means to monitor treatment processes and can be combined with ultrasound treatment to overcome ovarian cancer resistance in vitro and in vivo.",Biomaterials,2021,downloaded,10.1016/j.biomaterials.2020.120478

Herein, ultrasmall iron-doped titanium oxide nanodots (Fe-TiO2 NDs) are synthesized via a thermal decomposition strategy as a type of sonosensitizers to enhance SDT. Interestingly, the Fe doping in this system appears to be crucial in not only enhancing the US-triggered ROS generation of those NDs but also offering NDs the Fenton-catalytic function to generate ROS from tumor endogenous H2O2 for chemodynamic therapy (CDT). After polyethylene glycol (PEG) modification, Fe-TiO2-PEG NDs demonstrate good physiological stability and biocompatibility. With efficient tumor retention after intravenous injection as revealed by in vivo magnetic resonance (MR) and fluorescent imaging, our Fe-TiO2 NDs demonstrate much better in vivo therapeutic performance than commercial TiO2 nanoparticles owing to the combination of CDT and SDT. Moreover, most of those ultrasmall Fe-TiO2 NDs can be effectively excreted within one month, rendering no obvious long-term toxicity to the treated mice.

Herein, a multifunctional nanotheranostic agent FePtMn-Ce6/FA (FPMCF NPs) is constructed by covalently anchoring photosensitizer chlorin e6 (Ce6) and targeting molecule folic acid (FA) on ultrasmall homogeneous ternary FePtMn nanocrystals. Response to tumor microenvironment (TME), FPMCF NPs can release Fe2+ to catalyze H2 O2 into •OH by Fenton reaction and simultaneously catalyze hydrogen peroxide (H2 O2 ) into O2 to overcome the tumor hypoxia barrier. Released O2 is further catalyzed into 1 O2 under 660 nm laser irradiation with Ce6. Thus, the FPMCF NPs exhibit superior dual-ROS oxidization capability including ferroptosis chemodynamic oxidization and 1 O2 -based photodynamic oxidization. Interestingly, FPMCF NPs reveal strong photothermal conversion efficiency exposed to an 808 nm laser, which can assist dual-ROS oxidization to suppress solid tumor remarkably. Additionally, Mn2+ can be released from FPMCF NPs to enhance longitudinal relaxivity (T1 -weighted magnetic resonance (MR) imaging) and Fe-synergistic transverse relaxivity (T2 -weighted MR imaging), which is convenient for diagnosis of solid tumors. Meanwhile, the fluorescent/photothermal (FL/PT) imaging function of FPMCF NPs can also accurately monitor tumor location.

However, its clinical applications have been limited by the lack of a sonosensitizer that is capable of producing sufficient amounts of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in response to ultrasound (US) exposure. Herein, PEGylated mesoporous silica-titania nanoparticles (P-MSTNs) are prepared and used as US-responsive nanocarriers for cancer sonotheranostics. Perfluorohexane (PFH), which is chosen as the gas precursor, is physically encapsulated into P-MSTNs using the oil-in-water emulsion method. Owing to the vaporization of the gas precursor, PFH@P-MSTNs (137 nm in diameter) exhibit a strong photoacoustic signal in vivo for at least 6 h. Compared to P-MSTNs, PFH@P-MSTNs generate significantly higher amounts of ROS due to the nanobubble-induced cavitation in the presence of US. When systemically administered to tumor-bearing mice, PFH@P-MSTNs effectively accumulate in the tumor site due to the passive targeting mechanism. Consequently, PFH@P-MSTNs show much higher antitumor efficacy than P-MSTNs due to the enhanced cavitation-mediated ROS generation in response to US exposure. It is considered that PFH@P-MSTNs may hold significant potential for cancer sonotheranostics.",Advanced healthcare materials,2020,downloaded,10.1002/adhm.202000877

However, these two methods tend to be restricted by the overexpressed glutathione (GSH) and hypoxia in the tumor microenvironment (TME). Here, we develop biodegradable copper/manganese silicate nanosphere (CMSN)-coated lanthanide-doped nanoparticles (LDNPs) for trimodal imaging-guided CDT/PDT synergistic therapy. The tridoped Yb3+/Er3+/Tm3+ in the ultrasmall core and the optimal Yb3+/Ce3+ doping in the shell enable the ultrabright dual-mode upconversion (UC) and downconversion (DC) emissions of LDNPs under near-infrared (NIR) laser excitation. The luminescence in the second near-infrared (NIR-II, 1000-1700 nm) window offers deep-tissue penetration, high spatial resolution, and reduced autofluorescence when used for optical imaging. Significantly, the CMSNs are capable of relieving the hypoxic TME through decomposing H2O2 to produce O2, which can react with the sample to generate 1O2 upon excitation of UC photons (PDT). The GSH-triggered degradation of CMSNs results in the release of Fenton-like Mn2+ and Cu+ ions for •OH generation (CDT); simultaneously, the released Mn2+ ions couple with NIR-II luminescence imaging, computed tomography (CT) imaging, and magnetic resonance (MR) imaging of LDNPs, performing a TME-amplified trimodal effect. In such a nanomedicine, the TME modulation, bimetallic silicate photosensitizer, Fenton-like nanocatalyst, and NIR-II/MR/CT contrast agent were achieved ""one for all"", thereby realizing highly efficient tumor theranostics.",ACS nano,2020,downloaded,10.1021/acsnano.0c00082
32709842,Preparation of TiH1.924 nanodots by liquid-phase exfoliation for enhanced sonodynamic cancer therapy.,"Metal hydrides have been rarely used in biomedicine. Herein, we fabricate titanium hydride (TiH1.924) nanodots from its powder form via the liquid-phase exfoliation, and apply these metal hydride nanodots for effective cancer treatment. The liquid-phase exfoliation is an effective method to synthesize these metal hydride nanomaterials, and its efficiency is determined by the matching of surface energy between the solvent and the metal hydrides. The obtained TiH1.924 nanodots can produce reactive oxygen species (ROS) under ultrasound, presenting a highly efficient sono-sensitizing effect. Meanwhile, TiH1.924 nanodots with strong near-infrared (NIR) absorbance can serve as a robust photothermal agent. By using the mild photothermal effect to enhance intra-tumoral blood flow and improve tumor oxygenation, a remarkable synergistic therapeutic effect is achieved in the combined photothermal-sonodynamic therapy. Importantly, most of these TiH1.924 nanodots can be cleared out from the body. This work presents the promises of functional metal hydride nanomaterials for biomedical applications.",Nature communications,2020,downloaded,10.1038/s41467-020-17485-x
32706569,Oxygen Vacancy Defect-Induced Activity Enhancement of Gd Doping Magnetic Nanocluster for Oxygen Supplying Cancer Theranostics.,"This work finds that Fe3O4 nanoclusters can rearrange by Gd doping and then self-assemble to a hollow magnetic nanocluster (HMNC), providing larger magnetic moments to obtain an excellent MRI capability and increasing the number of oxygen vacancies in HMNC. The hollow structure makes platinum(IV) prodrugs effectively load into HMNC. Second, plenty of oxygen vacancy defects can capture oxygen molecules, enhance the catalytic activity of HMNC, and then promote intracellular ROS generation. On the basis of this, a targeting iRGD-labeled HMNC nanosystem (iHMNCPt-O2) is developed through loading oxygen molecules and platinum(IV) prodrugs for chemo- and chemodynamic therapy of cancer. This nanosystem shows an excellent response ability to weak acid and GSH, which can cause a series of cascade reactions in a cell. These cascade reactions are dramatically enhanced at the intracellular ROS level, cause mitochondria and DNA damage, and then induce cancer cell death. Besides, systemic delivery of iHMNCPt-O2 significantly enhanced the MRI contrast signal of tumors and improved the quality of MR images, accurately diagnosing tumors. Therefore, this work provides a novel method for accelerating the Fenton-like reaction and enhancing the MRI capability and fabricates a promising ""all-in-one"" system to overwhelm the problems of cancer theranostic.",ACS applied materials & interfaces,2020,downloaded,10.1021/acsami.0c09952.s001
32603033,An Oxidation-Enhanced Magnetic Resonance Imaging Probe for Visual and Specific Detection of Singlet Oxygen Generated in Photodynamic Cancer Therapy In Vivo.,"Singlet oxygen is regarded as the primary cytotoxic agent in cancer photodynamic therapy (PDT). Despite the advances in optical methods to image singlet oxygen, it remains a challenge for in vivo application due to the limited tissue penetration depth of light. Up to date, no singlet oxygen-specific magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) probe has been reported. Herein, a T2 -weighted MRI probe is reported to visually detect singlet oxygen generated in PDT in vitro and in vivo. The MRI probe Ce6/Fe3 O4 -M is constructed by co-encapsulation of photosensitizer Ce6 and Fe3 O4 nanoparticles in mPEG2000 -TK-C16 micelles. Thioketal (TK) linker in the probe is highly sensitive to singlet oxygen, but lowly sensitive to other reactive oxygen species (ROS) existing in physiological and pathological environments. Singlet oxygen, generated with light irradiation, triggers the cleavage of TK, which leads to loss of surface polyethylene glycol, increment of the hydrophobicity, and aggregation of Fe3 O4 nanoparticles. Subsequently, negatively enhanced T2 -weighted MRI signal is obtained for visual detection of singlet oxygen in the solution, cancer cells, and in vivo. This oxidation responsive MRI probe is expected to hold great promise in evaluating the ability of photosensitizers to generate singlet oxygen and in predicting the therapeutic efficacies of PDT in vivo.",Advanced healthcare materials,2020,downloaded,10.1002/adhm.202000533
32578659,Targeted GSH-exhausting and hydroxyl radical self-producing manganese-silica nanomissiles for MRI guided ferroptotic cancer therapy.,"Ferroptosis, a cell death path induced by the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), will cause the accumulation of lipid peroxides (PL-PUFA-OOH) and achieve potent tumor-regression. However, glutathione (GSH)-dependent glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPx4) can reduce PL-PUFA-OOH and antagonize the ferroptosis inducing effect of ROS. Herein, folate-PEG modified dihydroartemisinin (DHA) loaded manganese doped mesoporous silica nanoparticles (described as nanomissiles) were constructed for integrating the effect of GSH exhaustion and ROS generation. After endocytosis by tumor cells, intracellular GSH triggered the degradation of nanomissiles, which allowed the simultaneous release of DHA and Fenton catalytic Mn2+ due to the redox reaction between the manganese-oxygen bonds and GSH. The degradation would lead to GSH exhaustion, activation of Mn2+-based magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and DHA-driven ˙OH generation. The GSH-free environment inhibited the activity of GPx4 and enhanced the accumulation of PL-PUFA-OOH oxidized by ˙OH. Furthermore, the cooperative effects suppressed tumor metastasis by destroying the structure of polyunsaturated fatty acids in the cell membranes and showed potent antitumor activity. This innovative ferroptotic therapy integrating the GSH exhaustion and ROS generation will be a promising strategy for cancer therapy.",Nanoscale,2020,downloaded,10.1039/d0nr02396e
32440551,A multistage assembly/disassembly strategy for tumor-targeted CO delivery.,"CO gas molecule not only could selectively kill cancer cells but also exhibits limited anticancer efficacy because of the lack of active tumor-targeted accumulation capability. In this work, a multistage assembly/disassembly strategy is developed to construct a new intelligent nanomedicine by encapsulating a mitochondria-targeted and intramitochondrial microenvironment-responsive prodrug (FeCO-TPP) within mesoporous silica nanoparticle that is further coated with hyaluronic acid by step-by-step electrostatic assembly, realizing tumor tissue-cell-mitochondria-targeted multistage delivery and controlled release of CO in a step-by-step disassembly way. Multistage targeted delivery and controlled release of CO involve (i) the passive tumor tissue-targeted nanomedicine delivery, (ii) the active tumor cell-targeted nanomedicine delivery, (iii) the acid-responsive prodrug release, (iv) the mitochondria-targeted prodrug delivery, and (v) the ROS-responsive CO release. The developed nanomedicine has effectively augmented the efficacy and safety of CO therapy of cancer both in vitro and in vivo.

In this work, we rationally prepared MOF-derived double-layer hollow manganese silicate nanoparticle (DHMS) with highly effective ROS yield under ultrasound irradiation for multimodal imaging-guided sonodynamic therapy (SDT). The presence of Mn in DHMS increased ROS generation efficiency because it could be oxidized by holes to improve the electron-hole separation. Moreover, DHMS could produce oxygen in the tumor microenvironment, which helps overcome the hypoxia of the solid tumor and thus enhance the treatment efficiency. In vivo experiments demonstrated efficient tumor inhibition in DHMS-mediated SDT guided by ultrasound and magnetic resonance imaging. This work presents a MOF-derived nanoparticle with sonosensitive and oxygen generating ability, which provides a promising strategy for tumor hypoxia in SDT.",Angewandte Chemie (International ed. in English),2020,downloaded,10.1002/anie.202004894
32330380,Integration of Fe3O4 with Bi2S3 for Multi-Modality Tumor Theranostics.,"The combination of reactive oxygen species (ROS)-induced chemodynamic therapy (CDT) and photothermal therapy (PTT) holds a promising application prospect for their superb anticancer efficiency. Herein, we created a novel Fe3O4@polydopamine (PDA)@bovine serum albumin (BSA)-Bi2S3 composite as a theranostic agent, by chemically linking the Fe3O4@PDA with BSA-Bi2S3 via the amidation between the carboxyl groups of BSA and the amino groups of PDA. In this formulation, the Fe3O4 NPs could not only work as a mimetic peroxidase to trigger Fenton reactions of the innate H2O2 in the tumor and generate highly cytotoxic hydroxyl radicals (•OH) to induce tumor apoptosis but also serve as the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) contrast agent to afford the precise cancer diagnosis. Meanwhile, the PDA could prevent the oxidization of Fe3O4, thus supporting the long-term Fenton reactions and the tumor apoptosis in the tumor. The Bi2S3 component exhibits excellent photothermal transducing performance and computed tomography (CT) imaging capacity. In addition, the PDA and Bi2S3 endow the Fe3O4@PDA@BSA-Bi2S3 composite with an excellent photothermal transforming ability which could lead to tumor hyperthermia. All of these merits play the synergism with the tumor microenvironment and qualify the Fe3O4@PDA@BSA-Bi2S3 NPs for a competent agent in the MRI/CT-monitored enhanced PTT/CDT synergistic therapy. Findings in this research will evoke new interests in future cancer therapeutic strategies based on biocompatible nanomaterials.",ACS applied materials & interfaces,2020,downloaded,10.1021/acsami.0c05088.s001
32286784,Enzyme-Triggered Transcytosis of Dendrimer-Drug Conjugate for Deep Penetration into Pancreatic Tumors.,"The dense fibrotic stroma in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA) resists drug diffusion into the tumor and leads to an unsatisfactory prognosis. To address this problem, we demonstrate a dendrimer-camptothecin (CPT) conjugate that actively penetrates deep into PDA tumors through γ-glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT)-triggered cell endocytosis and transcytosis. The dendrimer-drug conjugate was synthesized by covalent attachment of CPT to polyamidoamine (PAMAM) dendrimers through a reactive oxygen species (ROS)-sensitive linker followed with surface modification with glutathione. Once the conjugate was delivered to the PDA tumor periphery, the overexpressed GGT on the vascular endothelial cell or tumor cell triggers the γ-glutamyl transfer reactions of glutathione to produce primary amines. The positively charged conjugate was rapidly internalized via caveolae-mediated endocytosis and followed by vesicle-mediated transcytosis, augmenting its deep penetration within the tumor parenchyma and releasing active CPT throughout the tumor after cleavage by intracellular ROS. The dendrimer-drug conjugate exhibited high antitumor activity in multiple mice tumor models, including patient-derived PDA xenograft and orthotopic PDA cell xenograft, compared to the standard first-line chemotherapeutic drug (gemcitabine) for advanced pancreatic cancer. This study demonstrates the high efficiency of an active tumor-penetrating dendrimer-drug conjugate via transcytotic transport with ROS-responsive drug release for PDA therapy.",ACS nano,2020,downloaded,10.1021/acsnano.0c00974
32278102,Development of an ultrasound triggered nanomedicine-microbubble complex for chemo-photodynamic-gene therapy.,"Recently, combination therapy has received much attention because of its highly therapeutic effect in various types of cancers. In particular, chemo-photodynamic combination therapy has been considered as an outstanding strategy. However, an abnormal increase in tumor angiogenesis caused by reactive oxygen species (ROS) generated during photodynamic therapy (PDT) has been reported. In this study, the complex of doxorubicin (DOX)-encapsulating anti-angiogenic small interfering RNA (siRNA) nanoparticle and chlorin e6 (Ce6)-encapsulating microbubble has been developed to suppress tumor angiogenesis. The first compartment, doxorubicin-encapsulating siRNA nanoparticle, was electrostatically coated using two biocompatible polymers to prevent the damage of genetic materials. The other part, Ce6-encapsulating microbubble, serves as an ultrasound-triggered local delivery system as well as a drug carrier. Both the in vitro and in vivo experimental results demonstrate successful inhibition of angiogenesis with a minimized damage of siRNAs caused by ROS as well as improved therapeutic effect by chemo-photodynamic-gene triple combination therapy using ultrasound-triggered local delivery.","Nanomedicine : nanotechnology, biology, and medicine",2020,downloaded,10.1016/j.nano.2020.102194
32255341,Carbon Nitride Hollow Theranostic Nanoregulators Executing Laser-Activatable Water Splitting for Enhanced Ultrasound/Fluorescence Imaging and Cooperative Phototherapy.,"The limited efficacy of ""smart"" nanotheranostic agents in eradicating tumors calls for the development of highly desirable nanoagents with diagnostics and therapeutics. Herein, to surmount these challenges, we constructed an intelligent nanoregulator by coating a mesoporous carbon nitride (C3N4) layer on a core-shell nitrogen-doped graphene quantum dot (N-GQD)@hollow mesoporous silica nanosphere (HMSN) and decorated it with a P-PEG-RGD polymer, to achieve active-targeting delivery (designated as R-NCNP). Upon irradiation, the resultant R-NCNP nanoregulators exhibit significant catalytic breakdown of water molecules, causing a sustainable elevation of oxygen level owing to the C3N4 shell, which facilitates tumor oxygenation and relieves tumor hypoxia. The generated oxygen bubbles serve as an echogenic source, triggering tissue impedance mismatch, thereby enhancing the generation of an echogenicity signal, making them laser-activatable ultrasound imaging agents. In addition, the encapsulated photosensitizers and C3N4-layered photosensitizer are simultaneously activated to maximize the yield of ROS, actualizing a triple-photosensitizer hybrid nanosystem exploited for enhanced PDT. Intriguingly, the N-GQDs endow the R-NCNP nanoregulator with a photothermal effect for hyperthemia, making it exhibit considerable photothermal outcomes and infrared thermal imaging (IRT). Importantly, further analysis reveals that the polymer-modified R-NCNPs actively target specific tumor tissues and display a triple-modal US/IRT/FL imaging-assisted cooperative PTT/PDT for real-time monitoring of tumor ablation and therapeutic evaluation. The rational synergy of triple-model PDT and efficient PTT in the designed nanoregulator confers excellent anticancer effects, as evidenced by in vitro and in vivo assays, which might explore more possibilities in personalized cancer treatment.",ACS nano,2020,downloaded,10.1021/acsnano.9b08737.s001
32223222,Osteotropic Radiolabeled Nanophotosensitizer for Imaging and Treating Multiple Myeloma.,"Rapid liver and spleen opsonization of systemically administered nanoparticles (NPs) for in vivo applications remains the Achilles' heel of nanomedicine, allowing only a small fraction of the materials to reach the intended target tissue. Although focusing on diseases that reside in the natural disposal organs for nanoparticles is a viable option, it limits the plurality of lesions that could benefit from nanomedical interventions. Here we designed a theranostic nanoplatform consisting of reactive oxygen (ROS)-generating titanium dioxide (TiO2) NPs, coated with a tumor-targeting agent, transferrin (Tf), and radiolabeled with a radionuclide (89Zr) for targeting bone marrow, imaging the distribution of the NPs, and stimulating ROS generation for cell killing. Radiolabeling of TiO2 NPs with 89Zr afforded thermodynamically and kinetically stable chelate-free 89Zr-TiO2-Tf NPs without altering the NP morphology. Treatment of multiple myeloma (MM) cells, a disease of plasma cells originating in the bone marrow, with 89Zr-TiO2-Tf generated cytotoxic ROS to induce cancer cell killing via the apoptosis pathway. Positron emission tomography/X-ray computed tomography (PET/CT) imaging and tissue biodistribution studies revealed that in vivo administration of 89Zr-TiO2-Tf in mice leveraged the osteotropic effect of 89Zr to selectively localize about 70% of the injected radioactivity in mouse bone tissue. A combination of small-animal PET/CT imaging of NP distribution and bioluminescence imaging of cancer progression showed that a single-dose 89Zr-TiO2-Tf treatment in a disseminated MM mouse model completely inhibited cancer growth at euthanasia of untreated mice and at least doubled the survival of treated mice. Treatment of the mice with cold Zr-TiO2-Tf, 89Zr-oxalate, or 89Zr-Tf had no therapeutic benefit compared to untreated controls. This study reveals an effective radionuclide sensitizing nanophototherapy paradigm for the treatment of MM and possibly other bone-associated malignancies.",ACS nano,2020,downloaded,10.1021/acsnano.9b09618
32193923,Hydrogen Peroxide-Activatable Nanoparticles for Luminescence Imaging and In Situ Triggerable Photodynamic Therapy of Cancer.,"Abnormally increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) are intimately related to the development and metastasis of cancer. Since hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) is a major component of ROS, molecular imaging and selective treatment in response to high H2O2 are intriguing for the management of cancers. Herein, we report novel self-assembly luminescent nanoparticles, which can be activated by H2O2, thereby serving as an effective nanotheranostics for luminescence imaging and in situ photodynamic therapy (PDT) of tumors with high H2O2. This functional nanomedicine was assembled from an amphiphilic conjugate (defined as CLP) based on chlorin e6 (Ce6) simultaneously conjugated with luminol and poly(ethylene glycol), exhibiting a well-defined core-shell nanostructure. Upon triggering by pathologically relevant levels of H2O2, CLP nanoparticles produced luminescence due to the luminol unit and simultaneous excitation of Ce6 by chemiluminescence resonance energy transfer, enabling in vitro and in vivo imaging of tumors with highly expressed H2O2. In addition, excited Ce6 can produce singlet oxygen (1O2) for in situ PDT of H2O2-high tumors and inhibiting lung metastasis, which was demonstrated by in vitro and in vivo experiments. Furthermore, preliminary studies revealed the biosafety of CLP nanoparticles. Consequently, the self-illuminating nanoparticles are promising for noninvasive imaging and therapy of tumors with high expression of H2O2.",ACS applied materials & interfaces,2020,downloaded,10.1021/acsami.0c01413.s001
32167740,"Tumor-Specific Endogenous FeII-Activated, MRI-Guided Self-Targeting Gadolinium-Coordinated Theranostic Nanoplatforms for Amplification of ROS and Enhanced Chemodynamic Chemotherapy.","Low drug payload and lack of tumor-targeting for chemodynamic therapy (CDT) result in an insufficient reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, which seriously hinders its further clinical application. Therefore, how to improve the drug payload and tumor targeting for amplification of ROS and combine it with chemotherapy has been a huge challenge in CDT. Herein, methotrexate (MTX), gadolinium (Gd), and artesunate (ASA) were used as theranostic building blocks to be coordinately assembled into tumor-specific endogenous FeII-activated and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-guided self-targeting carrier-free nanoplatforms (NPs) for amplification of ROS and enhanced chemodynamic chemotherapy. The obtained ASA-MTX-GdIII NPs exhibited extremely high drug payload (∼96 wt %), excellent physiological stability, long circulating ability (half-time: ∼12 h), and outstanding tumor accumulation. Moreover, ASA-MTX-GdIII NPs could be specifically uptaken by tumor cells via folate (FA) receptors and subsequently be disassembled via lysosomal acidity-induced coordination breakage, resulting in drug burst release. Most strikingly, the produced ASA could be catalyzed by tumor-specific overexpressed endogenous FeII ions to generate sufficient ROS for enhancing the main chemodynamic efficacy, which could exert a synergistic effect with the assistant chemotherapy of MTX. Interestingly, ASA-MTX-GdIII NPs caused a lower ROS generation and toxicity on normal cell lines that seldom expressed endogenous FeII ions. Under MRI guidance with assistance of self-targeting, significantly superior synergistic tumor therapy was performed on FA receptor-overexpressed tumor-bearing mice with a higher ROS generation and an almost complete elimination of tumor. This work highlights ASA-MTX-GdIII NPs as an efficient chemodynamic-chemotherapeutic agent for MRI imaging and tumor theranostics.",ACS applied materials & interfaces,2020,downloaded,10.1021/acsami.0c00970.s001
32004587,Mesoporous polydopamine carrying sorafenib and SPIO nanoparticles for MRI-guided ferroptosis cancer therapy.,"Iron-based nanomaterials as the main ferroptosis-inducing platforms are more promising because iron itself is a key component in the Fenton reaction to produce ROS. However, the Fe dose needs to be very high in order to induce ferroptosis-based cancer treatment using the SPIO NPs. Therefore, it is still of great challenge to enhance the efficacy of ferroptosis-based cancer therapy by associating the iron-based nanomaterials with other components and therapeutic modalities. In this study, sorafenib (SRF) and ultrasmall SPIO nanoparticles were loaded into the mesopores and onto the surface of MPDA NPs to form SRF@MPDA-SPIO nanoparticles. SPIO loading endowed the system with iron-supply for ferroptosis and made the system MRI-visible. Meanwhile, SRF was able to induce ferroptosis in cancer cells with lower Fe dose. Furthermore, the heat generated by MPDA NPs upon laser irradiation offered a moderate PTT to boost the ferroptosis effect. The SRF@MPDA-SPIO exhibited biocompatibility highly desirable for in vivo application and superior anticancer therapy via the combination of ferroptosis and photothermal therapy.",Journal of controlled release : official journal of the Controlled Release Society,2020,downloaded,10.1016/j.jconrel.2020.01.048
31961656,Graphene Oxide-Grafted Magnetic Nanorings Mediated Magnetothermodynamic Therapy Favoring Reactive Oxygen Species-Related Immune Response for Enhanced Antitumor Efficacy.,"In this study, a magnetothermodynamic (MTD) therapy is introduced as an efficient systemic cancer treatment, by combining the magnetothermal effect and the reactive oxygen species (ROS)-related immunologic effect, in order to overcome the obstacle of limited therapeutic efficacy in current magnetothermal therapy (MTT). This approach was achieved by the development of an elaborate ferrimagnetic vortex-domain iron oxide nanoring and graphene oxide (FVIOs-GO) hybrid nanoparticle as the efficient MTD agent. Such a FVIOs-GO nanoplatform was shown to have high thermal conversion efficiency, and it was further proved to generate a significantly amplified ROS level under an alternating magnetic field (AMF). Both in vitro and in vivo results revealed that amplified ROS generation was the dominant factor in provoking a strong immune response at a physiological tolerable temperature below 40 °C in a hypoxic tumor microenvironment. This was supported by the exposure of calreticulin (CRT) on 83% of the 4T1 breast cancer cell surface, direct promotion of macrophage polarization to pro-inflammatory M1 phenotypes, and further elevation of tumor-infiltrating T lymphocytes. As a result of the dual action of magnetothermal effect and ROS-related immunologic effect, impressive in vivo systemic therapeutic efficacy was attained at a low dosage of 3 mg Fe/kg with two AMF treatments, as compared to that of MTT (high dosage of 6-18 mg/kg under four to eight AMF treatments). The MTD therapy reported here has highlighted the inadequacy of conventional MTT that solely relies on the heating effect of the MNPs. Thus, by employing a ROS-mediated immunologic effect, future cancer magnetotherapies can be designed with greatly improved antitumor capabilities.",ACS nano,2020,downloaded,10.1021/acsnano.9b08320.s001

Herein, a smart biodegradable drug delivery nanoplatform with mitochondrial-targeted ability, pH-responsive drug release and enzyme-like catalytic function is designed. This efficient ROS-generating platform uses ultrasound with deeper penetration capability as excitation source for combined chemotherapy and sonodynamic therapy (SDT) of tumor. In vitro experiments show that the nanoplatform can co-load Ce6 and DOX and be degraded in slight acid environment, and the DOX release rate is 63.91 ± 1.67%. In vivo experiments show that the nanoplatform has extremely biosafety and can be enriched in tumor site and excluded from body after 24 h. More significantly, after combined treatment, the tumors are eliminated and the mice still survive healthily without recurrence after 60 d. This is because not only it can achieve mitochondrial targeting and use platinum particle to increase oxygen content in TME to enhance the effect of SDT, but also it can use weak acidic TME to accelerate drug release to achieve the combination of chemotherapy and SDT.

However, the surface of TiO2-x NPs is deficient in free active groups or radicals to conjugate functional therapeutic molecules, which seriously impedes their in-depth development for versatile medical applications. In this study, surface activation of TiO2-x NPs was realized by the facile conjugation of (3-aminopropyl)triethoxysilane (APTES) through the formation of a stable Si-O-Ti bond, and photosensitizer chlorin e6 (Ce6) was successfully modified onto the TiO2-x NP surface and with a considerably high loading content. The resultant TiO2-x@APTES/Ce6 (TAC) NPs displayed decent biosafety, rapid tumor enrichment and outstanding performance in photoacoustic (PA) imaging. Taking advantage of the intense photo-absorption in the near-infrared (NIR) region and high dose of conjugated Ce6, a powerful antitumor effect was realized based on the combination of hyperthermia-induced cell ablation and cytotoxic reactive oxygen species (ROS)-triggered apoptosis both in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, PA imaging guidance was exceptionally useful for locating the tumor position and optimizing the treatment regimens. Apart from Ce6, this elaborate modification strategy for TiO2-x is believed to be universal for steadily binding more versatile therapeutic agents, which would definitely favor the development of multifunctional TiO2-x-based nanocomplexes for enhanced tumor treatment.",Nanoscale,2020,downloaded,10.1039/c9nr09423g
31846619,Charge-reversal nanocarriers: An emerging paradigm for smart cancer nanomedicine.,"The surface charge of nanoparticles (NPs) plays an essential role in determining their biological properties both in vitro and in vivo. In view of the complex features associated with the biological or physiological microenvironment of solid tumors, such as electrostatic interactions between NPs and serum components, cellular membrane, or intracellular organelles, drug-loaded NPs (or nanocarriers) should intelligently accommodate such unique extra- or intracellular microenvironment in order to achieve maximum therapeutic and/or diagnostic efficacy. To that end, the surface charge of nanocarriers needs to be readily converted at the target site by means of charge reversal, i.e., conversion from anionic to cationic, or vice versa, depending on specific microenvironment. In such a manner, the payloads could be efficiently released at the desired tumor site. This review discusses 1) the physicochemical aspects related to long-circulating nanocarriers for systemic applications; 2) the recent progress in charge-reversal nanocarriers, which are loaded with drugs, nucleic acids, proteins or imaging agents and triggered by various biological signals (i.e., pH, redox, ROS or enzyme) associated with tumor microenvironment, with an emphasis on those induced by acidic tumoral pH; and 3) the perspectives of charge-reversal nanocarriers regarding thorough investigations on how the chemical structure of charge-reversal moiety temporally affects the responsiveness of the resulting nanocarriers toward the rational design of precision cancer nanomedicine.",Journal of controlled release : official journal of the Controlled Release Society,2020,downloaded,10.1016/j.jconrel.2019.12.024

However, CDT agents that can emit ROS-related signals are rare. Herein, we synthesize a semiconducting polymer nanoplatform (SPN) that can not only produce highly toxic ROS to kill cancer cells but also emit ROS-correlated chemiluminescent signals. Notably, the efficacy of both chemiluminescence and CDT can be significantly enhanced by hemin doping (∼10-fold enhancement for luminescent intensity). Such ROS-dependent chemiluminescence of SPN allows ROS generation within a tumor to be optically monitored during the CDT process. Importantly, SPN establishes an excellent correlation of chemiluminescence intensities with cancer inhibition rates in vitro and in vivo. Thus, our nanoplatform represents the first intelligent strategy that enables chemiluminescence-imaging-monitored CDT, which holds potential in assessing therapeutic responsivity and predicting treatment outcomes in early stages.",Nano letters,2020,downloaded,10.1021/acs.nanolett.9b03556.s001

However, the drug leakage during blood circulation, poor cellular uptake of drug-loaded nanoparticles, and insufficient drug release still remain to be overcome. Herein, a hierarchical pH and reactive oxygen species (ROS)-responsive nanoplatform is constructed labeling with a two-photon fluorophore developed by us, aiming for a programmed drug delivery and an intensive two-photon bioimaging. With the capecitabine (Cap) conjugated, the prodrug polymer PMPC-b-P[MPA(Cap)-co-TPMA]-PAEMA (PMMTAb-Cap) can be self-assembled into the core-shell structured micelles, which can stay stable in the blood stream. Once the micelles accumulate at the tumor tissue, the outside PMPC shell can be desquamated while the inner PAEMA become hydrophilic and electropositive under the acidic extracellular tumor microenvironment, leading to a shrunken micellar size for the better penetration along with enhanced endocytosis. After cellular internalization, the overexpressed intracellular ROS can eventually trigger the drug delivery for an accurate tumor therapy, which is confirmed by the in vivo antitumor experiments. Furthermore, the in vivo micellar biodistribution can be traced by a deep tissue imaging up to 150 μm because of the aggregation-induced emission active two-photon fluorophore. As a theranostic nanoplatform with two-photon bioimaging and hierarchical responsiveness, these PMMTAb-Cap micelles can be a potential candidate for tumor theranostical applications.",ACS applied materials & interfaces,2019,downloaded,10.1021/acsami.9b17587

Radiotherapy can be applied to patients externally (external beam radiotherapy) or internally (brachytherapy and radioisotope therapy). Previously, nanoencapsulation of radioactive crystals within carbon nanotubes, followed by end-closing, resulted in the formation of nanocapsules that allowed ultrasensitive imaging in healthy mice. Herein we report on the preparation of nanocapsules initially sealing ""cold"" isotopically enriched samarium (152Sm), which can then be activated on demand to their ""hot"" radioactive form (153Sm) by neutron irradiation. The use of ""cold"" isotopes avoids the need for radioactive facilities during the preparation of the nanocapsules, reduces radiation exposure to personnel, prevents the generation of nuclear waste, and evades the time constraints imposed by the decay of radionuclides. A very high specific radioactivity is achieved by neutron irradiation (up to 11.37 GBq/mg), making the ""hot"" nanocapsules useful not only for in vivo imaging but also therapeutically effective against lung cancer metastases after intravenous injection.

Now, ultrasound (US) and glutathione (GSH) dual responsive vesicles of Janus Au-MnO nanoparticles (JNPs) were coated with PEG and a ROS-sensitive polymer. Upon US irradiation, the vesicles were disassembled into small Janus Au-MnO nanoparticles (NPs) with promoted penetration ability. Subsequently, GSH-triggered MnO degradation simultaneously released smaller Au NPs as numerous cavitation nucleation sites and Mn2+ for chemodynamic therapy (CDT), resulting in enhanced reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation. This also allowed dual-modality photoacoustic imaging in the second near-infrared (NIR) window and T1 -MR imaging due to the released Mn2+ , and inhibited orthotopic liver tumor growth via synergistic SDT/CDT.",Angewandte Chemie (International ed. in English),2020,downloaded,10.1002/ange.201912768
31666202,Drug-loaded titanium dioxide nanoparticle coated with tumor targeting polymer as a sonodynamic chemotherapeutic agent for anti-cancer therapy.,"Sonodynamic therapy utilizes ultrasound (US)-responsive generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) from sonosensitizer, and it is a powerful strategy for anti-cancer treatment in combination with chemotherapy. Herein, we report a precisely designed sonodynamic chemotherapeutics which exhibits US-responsive drug release via ROS generation from co-loaded sono-sensitizer. Doxorubicin (DOX)-coordinated titanium dioxide nanoparticles (TNPs) were encapsulated with polymeric phenyboronic acid (pPBA) via phenylboronic ester bond between pPBA and DOX. Loaded DOX was readily released under US irradiation due to the ROS-cleavable characteristics of phenylboronic ester bond. The size of nanoparticles was around 200 nm, and DOX was released by ROS generated under US irradiation. Tumor targeting by PBA moiety, intracellular ROS generation, and combined therapeutic effect against tumor cells were confirmed in vitro. Finally, we demonstrated high tumor accumulation and efficient tumor growth inhibition in tumor-bearing mice under US irradiation, which revealed potential as a multi-functional agent for sonodynamic chemotherapy.","Nanomedicine : nanotechnology, biology, and medicine",2020,downloaded,10.1016/j.nano.2019.102110
31664811,Biodegradable Hollow MoSe2/Fe3O4 Nanospheres as the Photodynamic Therapy-Enhanced Agent for Multimode CT/MR/IR Imaging and Synergistic Antitumor Therapy.,"Photodynamic therapy (PDT) is considered as one of the most effective cancer treatment strategies because of its minimally invasive and high efficiency. On account of the correlation between PDT and photocatalytic oxidation, the hollow MoSe2/Fe3O4 (MF-2) nanoheterostructure was constructed to enhance PDT as shown in this paper. The size and the hollow structure can be well controlled by the addition of F-127. MoSe2/Fe3O4 reveals the twofold reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation in contrast to the pure MoSe2, which is ascribed to the effective separation of photogenic charges. The novel hollow structure also supplies a lot of cavities for perfluorocarbon (PFC) and O2 loading, and O2@PFC@MF-2 can effectively overcome the hypoxic microenvironment to further cause more than 3 times ROS production. Moreover, the narrow band gap and hollow structure also make sure that the strong near-infrared (NIR) light absorption and high photothermal conversion efficiency is as high as 66.2%. Furthermore, the combination of Fe3O4 can further accelerate the effective biodegradation capacity of MF-2 because of the repeated endogenous redox reaction to form water-soluble MoVI-oxide species. Meanwhile, doxorubicin (Dox, anticancer drug) was assembled onto the MF-2@PEG nanomaterials through π-π staking and electrostatic interaction for chemotherapy. O2@PFC@MF-2@PEG/Dox possesses the potential application in triple-model computed tomography, magnetic resonance, and infrared (CT/MR/IR) imaging-guided photothermal/photodynamic/chemotherapy (PTT/PDT/chemotherapy) nanodiagnosis platforms.",ACS applied materials & interfaces,2019,downloaded,10.1021/acsami.9b17237.s001

Herein, a novel oxygen-deficient zirconia (ZrO2-x) nanosystem based on the conjugation of thiol-polyethylene glycol-amine (SH-PEG-NH2) and chlorin e6 (Ce6) was elaborately designed and established for efficacious photothermal/photodynamic therapy (PTT/PDT) and fluorescence/photoacoustic (FL/PA) bimodal imaging for the first time. The crystalline-disordered, PEGylated ZrO2-x nanoparticles (ZP NPs) displayed strong optical absorption in the near-infrared (NIR) window and were featured with significant photothermal conversion capacity. The ZP NPs were further covalently conjugated with Ce6 to form ZrO2-x@PEG/Ce6 (ZPC) NPs, which displayed a long circulatory half-life, efficient tumor accumulation, and outstanding FL/PA imaging performance. Moreover, the nanocomposites effectively generated cytotoxic intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) responsive to laser activation. Both cell studies and animal experiments explicitly demonstrated that ZPC NPs mediated remarkable tumor ablation with minimal systemic toxicity thanks to their tumor-specific PTT/PDT effect. Collectively, these findings may open up new avenues to broaden the application of oxygen-deficient ZrO2-x nanostructures as high-performance photothermal agents in tumor theranostics through rational design and accurate control of their physiochemical properties.",ACS applied materials & interfaces,2019,downloaded,10.1021/acsami.9b16604.s001
31576757,"NaCeF4:Gd,Tb Scintillator as an X-ray Responsive Photosensitizer for Multimodal Imaging-Guided Synchronous Radio/Radiodynamic Therapy.","Photosensitizers (PSs) that are directly responsive to X-ray for radiodynamic therapy (RDT) with desirable imaging abilities have great potential applications in cancer therapy. Herein, the cerium (Ce)-doped NaCeF4:Gd,Tb scintillating nanoparticle (ScNP or scintillator) is first reported. Due to the sensitization effect of the Ce ions, Tb ions can emit fluorescence under X-ray irradiation to trigger X-ray excited fluorescence (XEF). Moreover, Ce and Tb ions can absorb the energy of secondary electrons generated by X-ray to produce reactive oxide species (ROS) for RDT. With the intrinsic absorption of X-ray by lanthanide elements, the NaCeF4:Gd,Tb ScNPs also act as a computed tomography (CT) imaging contrast agent and radiosensitizers for radiotherapy (RT) sensitization synchronously. Most importantly, the transverse relaxation time of Gd3+ ions is shortened due to the doping of Ce and Tb ions, leading to the excellent performance of our ScNPs in T2-weighted MR imaging for the first time. Both in vitro and in vivo studies verify that our synthesized ScNPs have good performance in XEF, CT, and T2-weighted MR imaging, and a synchronous RT/RDT is achieved with significant suppression on tumor progression under X-ray irradiation. Importantly, no systemic toxicity is observed after intravenous injection of ScNPs. Our work highlights that ScNPs have potential in multimodal imaging-guided RT/RDT of deep tumors.",Nano letters,2019,downloaded,10.1021/acs.nanolett.9b03682.s001

In this work, an acidity-sensitive nanotheranostic agent (FePt@MnO)@DSPE-PEG5000-FA (FMDF NPs)  was successfully constructed for MR imaging guided ferroptosis chemodynamic therapy (FCDT) of cancer. The FMDF NPs could specifically target folic acid (FA) receptor-positive tumor cells (HeLa etc.) and induce ferroptosis efficiently by rapidly releasing active Fe2+ to catalyze intracellular H2O2 into ROS based on Fenton reaction. On the other hand, the Mn2+ could also be released due to acidity  and further coordinate with GSH to enhance the longitudinal-transverse relaxivity (T1/T2-weighted MR imaging), which could obviously strengthen the contrast distinction between solid tumors and the surrounding tissue to accurately real-time monitor the tumor location. Furthermore, the in vivo anticancer study revealed that the growth of solid tumor models could be suppressed remarkably after treating with FMDF NPs and no obvious damage to other major organs. Therefore, the FMDF NPs were competent simultaneously as an enhanced imaging diagnosis contrast agent and efficient therapy agent for promoting more precise and effective treatment in the bionanomedicine field.",ACS applied materials & interfaces,2019,downloaded,10.1021/acsami.9b11353.s001

Unfortunately, the therapeutic efficiency of ROS is unsatisfactory in clinic, primarily due to their rigorous production conditions. By taking advantage of the intrinsic acidity and overproduction of H2O2 in the tumor environment, we have reported an ROS nanoreactor based on core-shell-structured iron carbide (Fe5C2@Fe3O4) nanoparticles (NPs) through the catalysis of the Fenton reaction. These NPs are able to release ferrous ions in acidic environments to disproportionate H2O2 into •OH radicals, which effectively inhibits the proliferation of tumor cells both in vitro and in vivo. The high magnetization of Fe5C2@Fe3O4 NPs is favorable for both magnetic targeting and T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Ionization of these NPs simultaneously decreases the T2 signal and enhances the T1 signal in MRI, and this T2/T1 switching process provides the visualization of ferrous ions release and ROS generation for the supervision of tumor curing. These Fe5C2@Fe3O4 NPs show great potential in endogenous environment-excited cancer therapy with high efficiency and tumor specificity and can be guided further by MRI.",ACS nano,2019,downloaded,10.1021/acsnano.9b01740.s001

Here we report a pH/ROS dual-responsive nanomedicine consisting of β-lapachone (Lap), a pH-responsive polymer, and a ROS-responsive polyprodrug. In the intracellular acidic environment, the nanomedicine can realize pH-triggered disassembly. The released Lap can efficiently generate hydrogen peroxide, which will be further converted into highly toxic hydroxyl radicals via the Fenton reaction. Subsequently, through ROS-induced cleavage of thioketal linker, doxorubicin is released from the polyprodrug.

We herein developed cubic alpha-iron(III) oxide (α-Fe2O3) nanoparticles coated with ultrasmall gold nanoseeds, abbreviated as α-Fe2O3@Au, for the synergistic treatment of radiotherapy and photothermal therapy in breast cancer. The resultant NPs, with an average diameter of 49 nm, exhibited satisfactory biosafety profiles and provided tumor contrast in T2-weighted magnetic resonance (MR) imaging. The coating of ultrasmall Au nanoseeds exhibited strong absorption of near-infrared (NIR) laser that enabled to an efficacious photothermal therapy. It also sensitized radiotherapy, X-ray in this study, by generating large quantities of tumoricidal reactive oxygen species (ROS). Moreover, with the aid of NIR laser irradiation, the α-Fe2O3 substrate showed partial ablation and the Au NPs on its surface aggregated into a larger size (~13 nm), which has been proven to be the optimized size for radiotherapy. When tested in 4T1 murine breast cancer model, the α-Fe2O3@Au NPs significantly suppressed tumor growth (P < 0.01) when irradiated with a low-power laser (1.5 W/cm2 for 3 min) and an intermediate X-ray dose (6 Gy).

31331173,Dual-Functional Supernanoparticles with Microwave Dynamic Therapy and Microwave Thermal Therapy.,"The cytotoxic reactive oxygen species (ROS) generated by photoactivated sensitizers have been well explored in tumor therapy for nearly half a century, which is known as photodynamic therapy (PDT). The poor light penetration depth severely hinders PDT as a primary or adjuvant therapy for clinical indication. Whereas microwaves (MWs) are advantageous for deep penetration depth, the MW energy is considerably lower than that required for the activation of any species to induce ROS generation. Herein we find that liquid metal (LM) supernanoparticles activated by MW irradiation can generate ROS, such as ·OH and ·O2. On this basis, we design dual-functional supernanoparticles by loading LMs and an MW heating sensitizer ionic liquid (IL) into mesoporous ZrO2 nanoparticles, which can be activated by MW as the sole energy source for dynamic and thermal therapy concomitantly. The microwave sensitizer opens the door to an entirely novel dynamic treatment for tumors.",Nano letters,2019,downloaded,10.1021/acs.nanolett.9b01735.s001
31265050,A highly active (102) surface-induced rapid degradation of a CuS nanotheranostic platform for in situ T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging-guided synergistic therapy.,"Polyvinylpyrrolidone-modified CuS nanocrystals (CuS NCs) with high photothermal conversion efficiency (46%) and pH and near-infrared (NIR) light-triggered degradation properties are a promising nanotheranostic platform for in situ magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-guided synergistic photothermal and photodynamic therapy. On the one hand, the (102) surface of CuS NCs has a small bandgap based on density functional theory, which leads to high photothermal conversion efficiency. On the other hand, the S vacancy formation energy of the (102) surface is favourable. On entry into tumor cells through endocytosis, the S2- ions on the (102) surface of CuS NCs can be easily oxidized under the tumor microenvironment and 808 nm laser irradiation; then, a large amount of Cu+ ions can be released from CuS NCs and accelerate the degradation of nanocrystals. Cu+ ions can generate reactive oxygen species (ROS) under the tumor microenvironment and 808 nm laser irradiation. Meanwhile, the oxidation product Cu2+ ions can be generated from the oxidized Cu+ ions and applied for in situ T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging. Moreover, the biodegradable CuS NCs possess a high tumor uptake and can be rapidly excreted with a low long-term retention/toxicity. Therefore, degradable and multifunctional CuS NCs are a safe and efficient candidate for the diagnosis and treatment of cancer.",Nanoscale,2019,downloaded,10.1039/c9nr03830b
31264665,CuS-MnS2 nano-flowers for magnetic resonance imaging guided photothermal/photodynamic therapy of ovarian cancer through necroptosis.,"With a high incidence and high mortality rate, ovarian cancer presents a challenge for clinical practice. It is thus extremely urgent to investigate new diagnosis and therapy methods for the treatment of ovarian cancer. Ternary copper-based chalcogenide nanomaterials are attractive owing to their near infrared (NIR) response for cancer theranostic fields. However, improving the theranostic efficiency of these nanomaterials is challenging. Herein, CuS-MnS2 nano-flowers were easily synthesized and under NIR irradiation exhibited a relatively high photothermal conversion efficiency of 67.5% and a simultaneous reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation effect. Owing to these outstanding photothermal/photodynamic effects, excellent tumor ablation results could be achieved by the combined use of CuS-MnS2 nano-flowers and 808 nm NIR laser treatments. The main anticancer mechanism of CuS-MnS2 nano-flowers + NIR was likely necroptosis. In addition, the nano-flowers showed remarkable contrast enhancement according to magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).

Herein, the novel MoSe2/Bi2Se3 nanosheets were designed to integrate CT/photothermal (PT) imaging and photodynamic/photothermal/chemo-therapy (PTT/PDT/chemotherapy) into one nanoplatform. Firstly, the MoSe2 nanosheets (5-30 nm) were prepared via ultrasound-assisted exfoliated method, and then by a cation-exchange strategy the novel sandwich nanostructure Bi2Se3/MoSe2/Bi2Se3 (Bi-M-3) were obtained, revealing the narrower band gap (1.17 eV) and the stronger near-infrared (NIR) absorption. Both experimental and density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal the Z-scheme mechanism of charge transfer in the heterostructure, which induces the enhanced ROS (⋅OH) generation due to the efficient separation of photogenerated electron-hole pairs. Meanwhile, the nanoheterostructure also makes sure the improved photothermal conversion efficiency (59.3%). Besides, we also found the photothermal effect can promote the transfer photo-generated electron that is in favor of ROS generation. Furthermore, because of the higher absorption coefficient of X-ray for Bi atom, the heterostructure also exhibits the higher CT imaging contrast than pure MoSe2 sample. After the loading of anticancer drug Doxorubicin (Dox), Bi-M-3@PEG-Dox displays the acid/photothermal sensitive drug release behavior. The synergistic effect of chemotherapy, photodynamic and photothermal therapy further induces the superior cancer cell apoptosis and enhanced antitumor effect.",Biomaterials,2019,downloaded,10.1016/j.biomaterials.2019.119282

However, most of the previously reported gold nanocluster radiosensitizers do not have a precise atomic structure, causing difficulties in understanding the structure-activity relationship. In this study, a structurally defined gold-levonorgestrel nanocluster consisting of Au8(C21H27O2)8 (Au8NC) with bright luminescence (58.7% quantum yield) and satisfactory biocompatibility was demonstrated as a nanoradiosensitizer. When the Au8NCs were irradiated with X-rays, they produced reactive oxygen species (ROS), resulting in irreversible cell apoptosis. As indicated by in vivo tumor formation experiments, tumorigenicity was significantly suppressed after one radiotherapy treatment with the Au8NCs. In addition, compared with tumors treated with X-rays (4 Gy) alone, tumors treated with the nanosensitizer exhibited an inhibition rate of 74.2%.

To resolve these problems, we have developed a disassembled theranostic nanodrug Qu-FeIIP based on the quercetin coordination. Herein, quercetin is not only the heat shock protein (Hsp 70) inhibitor but also the skeleton of Qu-FeIIP, realizing near-infrared light induced low-temperature PTT (45 °C) to ablate tumor completely without heat stress to normal tissues. Owing to the ROS scavenging ability of quercetin, Qu-FeIIP effectively reduces intracellular ROS and in vivo inflammatory factors (TNF-α, IL-6, IFN-γ) levels. Simultaneously, quercetin-Fe coordination is weakened when scavenging ROS, which triggers the Qu-FeIIP disassembling, resulting in effective clearance of nanoparticles from main organs 168 h post intravenous injection. Additionally, the photoacoustic and magnetic resonance dual-imaging capability of Qu-FeIIP offers excellent spatial resolution and imaging depth not only for precise tumor diagnosis but also for monitoring the nanodrug disassembling in vivo. Thus, Qu-FeIIP intrinsically integrates precise diagnosis, excellent low-temperature PTT efficacy, ROS elimination and anti-inflammatory action, dynamic disassembly and renal clearance ability into a single nanodrug, which is very promising for future clinical cancer treatment.",Biomaterials,2019,downloaded,10.1016/j.biomaterials.2019.119280

However, the SDT efficacy is still not satisfactory without oxygen (O2) assistance. In addition, there is also much space to explore the SDT-based synergistic therapeutic modalities. Herein, a novel Pt-CuS Janus composed of hollow semiconductor CuS and noble metallic Pt was rationally designed and successfully synthesized. The hollow CuS shows a large inner cavity for loading sonosensitizer molecules (tetra-(4-aminophenyl) porphyrin, TAPP) to implement SDT. Moreover, the deposition of Pt not only enhances photothermal performance compared with those of CuS nanoparticles (NPs) due to the effect of the local electric field enhancement but also possesses nanozyme activity for catalyzing decomposition of endogenous overexpressed hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) to produce O2 that can overcome tumor hypoxia and augment the SDT-induced highly toxic reactive oxygen species (ROS) production for efficient cancer cell apoptosis. Importantly, the generated heat of Pt-CuS by 808 nm laser irradiation can accelerate the catalytic activity of Pt and elevate the O2 level that further facilitates SDT efficacy. Interestingly, the thermally sensitive copolymer coated around the Janus can act as a smart switch to regulate the catalytic ability of Pt and control TAPP release that has a significant effect on modulating the therapeutic effect. The synergistic catalysis-enhanced SDT efficiency and highly photothermal effect almost realized complete tumor resection without obvious reoccurrence and simultaneously displayed a highly therapeutic biosafety. Furthermore, the high optical absorbance allows the as-synthesized Pt-CuS Janus for photoacoustic (PA) imaging and NIR thermal imaging.

As confirmed that the structure of IF7-ROSPCNP was able to remain intact under normal physiological conditions. After IF7-ROSPCNP was selectively entrapped by the annexin 1-positive and ROS-abundant MCF-7/ADR cells, the shell of nanoparticles was ruptured and the entrapped photosensitizers were completely released out. Under irradiation, ROS was continuously produced and the DOX, which was conjugated to the terminal of polylactic copolymer (mPEG-PLA) by a ROS-cleavable linkage, was subsequently released. With such strategy, cellular uptake of drugs was dramatically improved resulted in an enhanced cytotoxicity and anti-tumor effect on drug resistant cancer.","Nanomedicine : nanotechnology, biology, and medicine",2019,downloaded,10.1016/j.nano.2019.03.007

Here we present endogenous reactive oxygen species (ROS)-triggered morphology transformation of polymer-peptide conjugates (PPCs) for cooperative interaction with mitochondria, exhibiting high tumor therapeutic efficacy. The PPCs are composed of (i) a β-sheet-forming peptide KLVFF conjugated with poly(ethylene glycol) through ROS-cleavable thioketal, (ii) a mitochondria-targeting cytotoxic peptide KLAK, and (iii) a poly(vinyl alcohol) backbone. The self-assembled PPCs nanoparticles can enter cells and target mitochondria. Because of overgenerated ROS around mitochondria in most cancer cells, the thioketal linker can be cleaved, leading to transformation from nanoparticles to fibrous nanostructures. As a result, the locational nanofibers with exposure of KLAK exhibit enhanced multivalent cooperative interactions with mitochondria, which causes selective cytotoxicity against cancer cells and powerful tumor suppression efficacy in vivo. As the first example of ROS-triggered intracellular transformation, the locational assembly strategy in vivo may provide a new insight for disease diagnosis and therapy through enhanced interaction with targeting site.",Journal of the American Chemical Society,2019,downloaded,10.1021/jacs.8b07727

By treating tumor cells (BxPC3 and PANC-1) with the conjugated MNPs and magnetic hyperthermia (43 °C, 60 min), cell death was observed. The two pancreatic tumor cell lines showed different reactions against the combined therapy according to their intrinsic sensitivity against Gemcitabine (cell death, ROS production, ability to activate ERK 1/2 and JNK). Finally, tumors (e.g. 3 mL) could be effectively treated by using almost 4.2 × 105 times lower Gemcitabine doses compared to conventional therapies. Our data show that this combinatorial therapy might well play an important role in certain cell phenotypes with low readiness of ROS production.

The mostly explored Fe-based Fenton nanocatalysts-enabled nanocatalytic cancer therapy substantially suffers from lowed pH condition and the corresponding therapeutic effect is still far from satisfactory for further clinic application. In this work, we report, for the first time, that copper (Cu)-based nanocatalysts have the intrinsic capability to catalyze hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) into hydroxyl radicals in a wide range pH condition with the comparable and even better performance as compared to mostly explored Fe-based nanocatalysts. Especially, ultrasmall (≤5 nm) PEGylated Cu2-xS nanodots (Cu2-xS-PEG) were fabricated to serve as the novel Fenton nanocatalysts for nanocatalytic tumor therapy. Importantly, taking the unique advantage of high near infrared (NIR) light absorbance at NIR-II biowindow (1000-1350 nm), light-activated photonic theranostic modality, i.e. photoacoustic imaging and photothermal therapy at both NIR-II biowindows was introduced, which could efficiently delineate/monitor the tumor regions and synergistically enhance Fenton-mediated therapeutic efficacy by photonic hyperthermia, respectively. Both systematic in vitro and in vivo experiments have demonstrated the high therapeutic efficacy of Cu2-xS-enabled synergistic photothermal hyperthermia-enhanced nanocatalytic therapy.

Among them, galvanic replacement, a structural transformation reaction accompanied by constituent element substitution, has been applied to various areas. However, the innovative improvement for galvanic replacement needs to be considered because of the limitation of applicable element pairs to maintain structural stability. To expand the boundary of galvanic-replacement-mediated synthesis, we have become interested in the Group 9 metallic element Ir, which is considered a fascinating element in the field of catalysis, but whose size and shape regulation has been conventionally regarded as difficult. To overcome the current limitations, we developed a hydrothermal galvanic-replacement-tethered synthetic route to prepare Ir-Ag-IrO2 nanoplates (IrNPs) with a transverse length of tens of nanometers and a rough surface morphology. A very interesting photoreactivity was observed from the prepared IrNPs, with Ag and IrO2 coexisting partially, which showed photothermal conversion and photocatalytic activity at different ratios against extinction wavelengths of 473, 660, and 808 nm. The present IrNP platform showed excellent photothermal conversion efficiency under near-infrared laser irradiation at 808 nm and also represented an effective cancer treatment in vitro and in vivo through a synergistic effect with reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation.

Accordingly, both the photothermal effect and reactive oxygen species (ROS) production could be realized under NIR light irradiation by SnxWO3 tungsten bronze nanocrystals, thereby triggering the potent in vivo photothermal and photodynamic synergistic therapy. Meanwhile, modified SnxWO3 tungsten bronze has the functions of photoacoustic imaging (PAI), X-ray computed tomography (CT) imaging and near-infrared fluorescence (NIRF) imaging for tumor detection as well. Finally, for investigating the antitumor mechanism of in vivo solid tumors, clinical imaging modalities of B-mode ultrasonography (US) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are employed to monitor the tumor evolution process after the photo-treatment, verifying a typically liquefactive necrosis process.

On the one hand, because the controlled TiO2 shells endow the Au NPL@TiO2 nanostructures with a red shift to the NIR II region, the as-prepared Au NPL@TiO2 nanostructures possess a high photothermal conversion efficiency of 42.05% when irradiated by a 1064 nm laser and are anticipated to be very promising candidates as photothermal agents. On the other hand, the Au nanoplates (Au NPLs), as electron traps, vastly improve the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) by the Au NPL@TiO2 nanostructures in contrast with pure TiO2 shell nanoparticles upon activation by ultrasound (US) via a sonodynamic process. Moreover, the toxicity and therapeutic effect of the Au NPL@TiO2 nanostructures were relatively systemically evaluated in vitro. The Au NPL@TiO2 nanostructures generate a large amount of intracellular ROS and exhibit laser power density-dependent toxicity, which eventually induces apoptosis of cancer cells. Furthermore, a synergistic therapeutic effect, with a cell viability of only 20.3% upon both photothermal and sonodynamic activation, was achieved at low concentrations of the Au NPL@TiO2 nanostructures. Experiments on mice also demonstrate the superiority of the combination of PTT and SDT, with the total elimination of tumors. This work provides a way of applying two-dimensional (2D) gold nanoplate core/TiO2 shell nanostructures as novel nanoagents for advanced multifunctional anticancer therapies in the second NIR window.",Nanoscale,2019,downloaded,10.1039/c8nr07188h
30662940,A self-illuminating nanoparticle for inflammation imaging and cancer therapy.,"Nanoparticles have been extensively used for inflammation imaging and photodynamic therapy of cancer. However, the major translational barriers to most nanoparticle-based imaging and therapy applications are the limited depth of tissue penetration, inevitable requirement of external irradiation, and poor biocompatibility of the nanoparticles. To overcome these critical limitations, we synthesized a sensitive, specific, biodegradable luminescent nanoparticle that is self-assembled from an amphiphilic polymeric conjugate with a luminescent donor (luminol) and a fluorescent acceptor [chlorin e6 (Ce6)] for in vivo luminescence imaging and photodynamic therapy in deep tissues. Mechanistically, reactive oxygen species (ROS) and myeloperoxidase generated in inflammatory sites or the tumor microenvironment trigger bioluminescence resonance energy transfer and the production of singlet oxygen (1O2) from the nanoparticle, enabling in vivo imaging and cancer therapy, respectively. This self-illuminating nanoparticle shows an excellent in vivo imaging capability with suitable tissue penetration and resolution in diverse animal models of inflammation. It is also proven to be a selective, potent, and safe antitumor nanomedicine that specifically kills cancer cells via in situ 1O2 produced in the tumor microenvironment, which contains a high level of ROS.",Science advances,2019,downloaded,10.1126/sciadv.aat2953

BPDC NSs have excellent photothermal conversion efficiency and a capacity of yielding reactive oxygen species (ROS) upon laser irradiation, and can realize on-demand drug release by either pH-activation or thermal induction. Accumulation of the nanodrug could be monitored in real-time by infrared thermal imaging, fluorescence imaging and computed tomography (CT). More importantly, the combination effects of photothermal therapy (PTT), photodynamic therapy (PDT) and chemotherapy were demonstrated to dramatically suppress solid tumors without recurrence in vivo. Featuring low systemic toxicity and high biocompatibility, this nanoplatform could be a promising derivative of Bi2S3 NSs for imaging-guided theranostics of cancer.","Nanomedicine : nanotechnology, biology, and medicine",2019,downloaded,10.1016/j.nano.2018.12.013
30589210,Metalloporphyrin Complex-Based Nanosonosensitizers for Deep-Tissue Tumor Theranostics by Noninvasive Sonodynamic Therapy.,"Metal complexes are widely used as anticancer drugs, while the severe side effects of traditional chemotherapy require new therapeutic modalities. Sonodynamic therapy (SDT) provides a significantly noninvasive ultrasound (US) treatment approach by activating sonosensitizers and initiating reactive oxygen species (ROS) to damage malignant tissues. In this work, three metal 4-methylphenylporphyrin (TTP) complexes (MnTTP, ZnTTP, and TiOTTP) are synthesized and encapsulated with human serum albumin (HSA) to form novel nanosonosensitizers. These nanosonosensitizers generate abundant singlet oxygen (1 O2 ) under US irradiation, and importantly show excellent US-activatable abilities with deep-tissue depths up to 11 cm. Compared to ZnTTP-HSA and TiOTTP-HSA, MnTTP-HSA exhibits the strongest ROS-activatable behavior due to the lowest highest occupied molecular orbital-lowest unoccupied molecular orbital gap energy by density functional theory. It is also effective for deep-tissue photoacoustic/magnetic resonance dual-modal imaging to trace the accumulation of nanoparticles in tumors. Moreover, MnTTP-HSA intriguingly achieves high SDT efficiency for simultaneously suppressing the growth of bilateral tumors away from ultrasound source in mice. This work develops a deep-tissue imaging-guided SDT strategy through well-defined metalloporphyrin nanocomplexes and paves a new way for highly efficient noninvasive SDT treatments of malignant tumors.","Small (Weinheim an der Bergstrasse, Germany)",2019,downloaded,10.1002/smll.201804028

The size of CDs were 2-5 nm, with an average size of 2.61 ± 0.7 nm. CDs were characterized by UV/vis spectroscopy, fluorescence spectroscopy, zeta potential, Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, and time-resolved fluorescence spectroscopy. CDs were known to emit blue fluorescence when excited at 360 nm, that is, UV region, and emit in the blue region of visible spectrum, that is, at 443 nm. CDs showed excitation-independent photoluminescence behavior and were highly fluorescent even at lower concentration under UV light. These CDs were highly fluorescent in nature, with the quantum yield being as high as 80%, which is comparable to that of organic dyes. The CDs were further used to image two different oral cancer cell lines, namely, FaDu (human pharyngeal carcinoma) and Cal-27 (human tongue carcinoma). The cell viability assay demonstarted that CDs were highly biocompatible, which was further confirmed by the side scattering studies as no change in the granularity was observed even at the highest concentration of 1600 μg/mL. The generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) was also investigated and negligible generaton of ROS was detected. In addition to that, the uptake phenomenon, cell cycle analysis, exocytosis, and cellular uptake at 4 °C and in the presence of ATP inhibitor were studied.

30346453,Ultrasound-targeted photodynamic and gene dual therapy for effectively inhibiting triple negative breast cancer by cationic porphyrin lipid microbubbles loaded with HIF1α-siRNA.,"Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), which is a kind of aggressive breast cancer, has a much higher recurrence rate and a shorter overall survival rate than other breast cancer subtypes owing to its lack of expression of the progesterone receptor (PR), estrogen receptor (ER) and HER2. For improving the therapeutic efficacy of TNBC, we developed a new kind of multifunctional cationic porphyrin-grafted lipid (CPGL) microbubble loaded with HIF 1α siRNA (siHIF@CpMB). Owing to the amphiphilic structure of CPGL, it can be self-assembled into microbubbles (MBs) with conventional lipids and the porphyrin group could be used as a photosensitizer for photodynamic therapy (PDT), while the amino group could adsorb HIF 1α siRNA (siHIF) through electrostatic adsorption. Such MBs possess a remarkably high drug loading content and less premature drug release. Distribution of MBs could be easily monitored by real-time US imaging (3-12 MHz). Furthermore, with the assistance of ultrasound targeted microbubble destruction (UTMD), siHIF@CpMBs could be efficiently converted into nanoparticles in situ, facilitating the accumulation of porphyrin and siRNA at the tumor site through the cavitation effect. HIF 1α siRNA down-regulated the HIF 1α level, which was induced by the common hypoxic tumor environment or the ROS (generated by PDT), enhanced the PDT efficacy and partly inhibited the tumor progression. Therefore, UTMD assisted combination of PDT and gene therapy was believed to be an effective therapeutic strategy for TNBC.",Nanoscale,2018,downloaded,10.1039/c8nr03074j

Unsaturated carbon dots (C-dots) anchored to liposomes convert near-infrared (NIR) light into heat and also produce reactive oxygen species (ROS), demonstrating the capability of phototriggered cancer cell death and tumor regression. The photothermal and oxidative damage of breast tumor by the nonmetallic nanohybrid has also been demonstrated. Designed nanoparticles show excellent aqueous dispersibility, biocompatibility, light irradiated enhanced cellular uptake, release of reactive oxygen species, prolonged and specific tumor binding ability and good photothermal response (62 °C in 5 minutes).

On account of the generative feedback between the intracellular redox cycling of VK3 and the high degree of ROS-triggered collapse of nanoparticles, VK3-CPT@Ru-CD can facilitate cancer-specific ROS amplification and drug release selectively in cancer cells, thus realizing the selective killing of tumor with minimal side-effects both in vitro and in vivo, the therapeutic effect of which is more prominent than the free anti-cancer drugs.

In this work, we developed a smart pH-controllable and H2O2-responsive nanoplatform with degradable property, which was based on honeycomb manganese oxide (hMnO2) nanospheres loaded with Ce6-sensitized core-shell-shell structured up-conversion nanoparticles (NaGdF4:Yb/Er,Tm@NaGdF4:Yb@NaNdF4:Yb) (abbreviated as hMUC). In the system, the speedy breakup of the as-prepared hMnO2 nanostructures results in release of loaded Ce6-sensitized UCNPs under the condition of H2O2 in acid solution. When exposed to tissue-penetrable 808 nm laser, up-conversion nanoparticles (UCNPs) emit higher-energy visible photons which would be absorbed by Ce6 to yield cytotoxic reactive oxygen species (ROS), thus triggering PDT treatment naturally. Moreover, the in vitro and in vivo experiments demonstrate that hMUC sample with the honeycomb-satellite structure can serve as multimodal bioimaging contrast agent for self-enhanced upconversion luminescence (UCL), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and computed tomography (CT) imaging, indicating that the as-prepared hMUC could be used in imaging-guided diagnosis and treatment, which has a potential application in the PDT treatment of tumor.",ACS applied materials & interfaces,2018,downloaded,10.1021/acsami.8b10207.s001

This effect triggers the photoactivity and generation of reactive oxygen species from Ag@ZnO NPs, which results in enhanced cytotoxic effects and apoptotic cell death in human breast cancer cells (MDA-MB231). In this context, upregulation of apoptotic cascade proteins (i.e., Bax/Bcl2 association, p53, cytochrome c, and caspase-3) along with activation of oxidative stress proteins suggested the occurrence of apoptosis by Ag@ZnO NPs in cancer cells through the mitochondrial pathway. Also, preincubation of breast cancer cells with Ag@ZnO NPs in dark conditions muted NP-related toxic effects and consequent apoptotic fate, highlighting biocompatible properties of unexcited Ag@ZnO NPs.

Herein, we reported biocompatible copper ferrite nanospheres (CFNs) with enhanced ROS production under irradiation with a 650 nm laser through direct electron transfer and photoenhanced Fenton reaction and high photothermal conversion efficiency upon exposure to an 808 nm laser, exhibiting a considerable improved synergistic treatment effect. Importantly, by exploiting the properties of O2 generation and glutathione (GSH) depletion of CFNs, CFNs relieve the hypoxia and antioxidant capability of the tumor, achieving photoenhanced CDT and improved PDT. The high relaxivity of 468.06 mM-1 s-1 enables CFNs to act as an outstanding contrast agent for MRI in vitro and in vivo.

However, the discovery of sonosensitizers with high sonosensitization efficacy and good stability is still a significant challenge. In this study, the great potential of a metal-organic-framework (MOF)-derived carbon nanostructure that contains porphyrin-like metal centers (PMCS) to act as an excellent sonosensitizer is identified. Excitingly, the superior sonosensitization effect of PMCS is believed to be closely linked to the porphyrin-like macrocycle in MOF-derived nanostructure in comparison to amorphous carbon nanospheres, due to their large highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO)-lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) gap for high reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. The nanoparticle-assisted cavitation process, including the visualized formation of the cavitation bubbles and microjets, is also first captured by high-speed camera. High ROS production in PMCS under ultrasound is validated by electron spin resonance and dye measurement, followed by cellular destruction and high tumor inhibition efficiency (85%). This knowledge is important from the perspective of understanding the structure-dependent SDT enhancement of a MOF-derived carbon nanostructure.","Advanced materials (Deerfield Beach, Fla.)",2018,downloaded,10.1002/adma.201800180

In this sense, it was highly desired to tackle the hypoxia-related negative issues. Here we provide the therapeutic agents delivery system, TPZ/HMTNPs-SNO, which was constructed by loading tirapazamine (TPZ) into hollow mesoporous titanium dioxide nanoparticles (HMTNPs) with modification of S-nitrosothiol (R-SNO). Upon encountering ultrasound waves, the HMTNPs as sonosensitizers would generate reactive oxygen species (ROS) for SDT. In a sequential manner, the followed SDT-induced hypoxia further activated the ""hypoxic cytotoxin"", TPZ, for hypoxia-specific killing effect. Meanwhile, the generated ROS could sensitize -SNO groups for on-demand nitric oxide (NO) release in an ""anticancer therapeutic window"", resulting in the NO sensitized SDT effect. This study confirmed that the TPZ/HMTNPs-SNO with multi-mechanisms exploited the merits of synergistic combination of the three therapeutic modes, consequently potentiating the anticancer efficacy of SDT. Moreover, the echogenic property of NO made the nanoplatform as an ultrasound contrast agent to enhance ultrasound imaging.

To address these issues, an oxygen-self-produced sonodynamic therapy (SDT) nanoplatform involving a modified fluorocarbon (FC)-chain-mediated oxygen delivery protocol has been established to realize highly efficient SDT against hypoxic pancreatic cancer. In this nanoplatform, mesopores and FC chains of FC-chain-functionalized hollow mesoporous organosilica nanoparticle carriers can provide sufficient storage capacity and binding sites for sonosensitizers (IR780) and oxygen, respectively. In vitro and in vivo experiments demonstrate the nanoplatform involving this distinctive oxygen delivery protocol indeed breaks the hypoxia-specific transportation barriers, supplies sufficient oxygen to hypoxic PANC-1 cells especially upon exposure to ultrasound irradiation, and relieves hypoxia. Consequently, hypoxia-induced resistance to SDT is inhibited and sufficient highly reactive oxygen species (ROS) are produced to kill PANC-1 cells and shrink hypoxic PANC-1 pancreatic cancer.

However, most nanotheranostic systems fail to regulate their generation levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) according to the disease microenvironment, which can potentially limit their therapeutic selectivity and increase the risk of damage to normal tissues. We herein report the development of hybrid semiconducting polymer nanoparticles (SPNs) with self-regulated near-infrared (NIR) photodynamic properties for optimized cancer therapy. The SPNs comprise a binary component nanostructure: a NIR-absorbing semiconducting polymer acts as the NIR fluorescent PDT agent, while nanoceria serves as the smart intraparticle regular to decrease and increase ROS generation at physiologically neutral and pathologically acidic environments, respectively. As compared with nondoped SPNs, the NIR fluorescence imaging ability of nanoceria-doped SPNs is similar due to the optically inactive nature of nanoceria; however, the self-regulated photodynamic properties of nanoceria-doped SPN not only result in dramatically reduced nonspecific damage to normal tissue under NIR laser irradiation but also lead to significantly enhanced photodynamic efficacy for cancer therapy in a murine mouse model.

However, the reactive oxygen species (ROS) generated by NIR-excited upconversion nanostructure is limited by the feeble upconverted light which cannot activate PDT agents efficiently. Here, an IR-808 dye sensitized upconversion nanoparticle (UCNP) with a chlorin e6 (Ce6)-functionalized silica layer is developed for PDT agent. The two booster effectors (dye-sensitization and core-shell enhancement) synergistically amplify the upconversion efficiency, therefore achieving superbright visible emission under low 808 nm light excitation. The markedly amplified red light subsequently triggers the photosensitizer (Ce6) to produce large amount of ROS for efficient PDT. After the silica is endowed with positive surface, these PDT nanoparticles can be easily grafted on MoS2 nanosheet. As the optimal laser wavelength of UCNPs is consistent with that of MoS2 nanosheet for PTT, the invented nanoplatform generates both abundant ROS and local hyperthermia upon a single 808 nm laser irradiation.

It is thus suggested that the doped NPs may be used as photoinducers to increase the efficacy of X-rays within the cells, consequently, cancer cell death. The doped NPs also could reduce the received dose by normal cells around the tumor. Additionally, we evaluated the diagnostic efficacy of doped NPs as CT/MRI nanoprobes. Results showed an efficient theranostic nanoparticulate system for simultaneous CT/MR imaging and cancer treatment.",ACS applied materials & interfaces,2016,downloaded,10.1021/acsami.5b10056
26587885,Reactive Oxygen Species-Manipulated Drug Release from a Smart Envelope-Type Mesoporous Titanium Nanovehicle for Tumor Sonodynamic-Chemotherapy.,"Despite advances in drug delivery systems (DDSs), the stimuli-responsive controlled release DDSs with high spatial/temporal resolution are still the best choice. Herein, a novel type of envelope-type mesoporous titanium dioxide nanoparticle (MTN) was developed for one-demand drug delivery platform. Docetaxel (DTX) was loaded in the pores of MTN with a high drug loading efficiency (∼26%). Then β-cyclodextrin (β-CD, a bulky gatekeeper) was attached to the outer surface of MTN via a reactive oxygen species (ROS) sensitive linker to block the pores (MTN@DTX-CD). MTN@DTX-CD could entrap the DTX in the pores and allow the rapid release until a focused ultrasound (US) emerged. A large number of ROS were generated by MTN under US radiation, leading to the cleavage of the ROS-sensitive linker; thus, DTX could be released rapidly since the gatekeepers (β-CD) were detached. Besides, the generation of ROS could also be used for tumor-specific sonodynamic therapy (SDT). Studies have shown the feasibility of MTN@DTX-CD for US-triggered DTX release and sonodynamic-chemotherapy. In the in vitro and in vivo studies, by integrating SDT and chemotherapy into one system, MTN@DTX-CD showed excellent antitumor efficacy. More importantly, this novel DDS significantly decreased the side effects of DTX by avoiding the spleen and hematologic toxicity to tumor-bearing mice.",ACS applied materials & interfaces,2015,downloaded,10.1021/acsami.5b09937
25770995,Dual-function nanosystem for synergetic cancer chemo-/radiotherapy through ROS-mediated signaling pathways.,"Radioresistance and limitation of irradiative dosage usually lead to failure in depletion of hypoxic tumors. Herein we developed multifunctional mesoporous silica nanoparticles (MSNs) as a carrier of a novel anticancer selenoamino acid (selenocystine, SeC), to achieve synergistic chemo-/radiotherapy. This multifunctional nanosystem effectively sensitizes cancer cells to X-ray radiotherapy. Conjugation of TAT cell penetrating peptide and transferrin to the surface of MSNs significantly enhances its internalization in cancer cells through receptor-mediated endocytosis. SeC@MSNs-Tf/TAT significantly enhanced X-ray-induced growth inhibition in cervical cancer cells by induction of apoptosis, mainly through death receptor-mediated extrinsic apoptotic pathway. Upon radiation, SeC@MSNs-Tf/TAT promoted intracellular ROS overproduction, which induced apoptotic cell death by affecting p53, AKT and MAPKs pathways. Furthermore, SeC@MSNs-Tf/TAT also significantly inhibited HeLa tumor growth in nude mice model through suppression of cell proliferation and induction of apoptosis. In vivo toxicity of the SeC@MSNs-Tf/TAT nanoparticles was investigated using the mouse model. The results of histological analysis revealed that, the nanoparticles did not show any obvious damage to these major organs under the experimental conditions, including heart, liver, spleen, lung and kidney. Taken together, this study demonstrates an effective and safe strategy for cancer-targeted chemo-/radiotherapy of human cancers.",Biomaterials,2015,downloaded,10.1016/j.biomaterials.2015.01.063
21787816,"Highly selective in-vivo imaging of tumor as an inflammation site by ROS detection using hydrocyanine-conjugated, functional nano-carriers.","Previously, the optical imaging of chitosan-functionalized, Pluronic-based nano-carriers by Cy5.5 conjugation revealed a good tumor targeting characteristic of the nano-carriers in vivo [J. Control. Release, 147 (2010) 109-117]. However, in spite of the relatively strong signal from tumor site, they also showed strong fluorescence signals from other organs, especially liver. Thus, for the detection of pathological sites, the direct use of the Cy5.5-conjugated nano-carriers is limited due to significant background signals associated with non-specific delivery of the probes. To overcome this limitation, in this study, we prepared hydrocyanine-conjugated and chitosan-functionalized Pluronic-based nano-carriers (Hydrocyanine-NC) that can detect ROS in pathological sites. The reduction of cyanine to hydrocyanine of the nano-carriers resulted in complete disappearance of fluorescence emission, and the fluorescence could be recovered by ROS-induced re-oxidization. Hydrocyanine-NC could detect various ROS including superoxide anion (O(2)(-)) and hydroxyl radical (OH(-)) in a dose-dependent manner. Hydrocyanine-NC was also stable in serum-containing media and did not show acute cytotoxicity. Hydrocyanine-NC developed strong fluorescence by the intracellular ROS formation in LPS-stimulated macrophage cells in vitro. As an in-vivo inflammation site imaging, SCC7 tumor-bearing mice were optically monitored after the i.v. injection of the dye-conjugated nano-carriers. When non-reduced, cyanine-conjugated and chitosan-functionalized Pluronic-based nano-carriers (Cyanine-NC) were injected, strong fluorescence emission was observed from the abdominal area as well as from the tumor site, and it remained over 2days. In contrast, in the case of Hydrocyanine-NC, the initially very weak fluorescence emission from the abdominal area disappeared over time whereas the fluorescence emission from the tumor site was similar to that of Cyanine-NC. Therefore, the re-oxidation of Hydrocyanine-NC by ROS in vivo specifically eliminated the background signals from non-specific delivery of the probes, but it produced fluorescence emission strong enough to monitor the target inflammation site selectively.",Journal of controlled release : official journal of the Controlled Release Society,2011,downloaded,10.1016/j.jconrel.2011.07.017
21034861,Selective toxicity of ZnO nanoparticles toward Gram-positive bacteria and cancer cells by apoptosis through lipid peroxidation.,"Nanoparticles are increasingly recognized for their utility in biological applications including nanomedicine. The present study investigated the toxicity of zinc oxide (ZnO) nanoparticles toward prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells. Cytotoxicity of ZnO to mammalian cells was studied using human myeloblastic leukemia cells (HL60) and normal peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). Antibacterial activity of ZnO was also tested against the Gram-negative bacteria Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, as well as the Gram-positive bacterium Staphylococcus aureus, and the effect was more pronounced with the Gram-positive than the Gram-negative bacteria. ZnO nanoparticles exhibited a preferential ability to kill cancerous HL60 cells as compared with normal PBMCs. The nanoparticles enhanced ultrasound-induced lipid peroxidation in the liposomal membrane. The work suggested two mechanisms underlying the toxicity of ZnO: (i) involvement of the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and (ii) induction of apoptosis. The work also revealed potential utility of ZnO nanoparticles in the treatment of cancer, for their selective toxicity to cancer cells.","Nanomedicine : nanotechnology, biology, and medicine",2011,downloaded,10.1016/j.nano.2010.10.001
18817971,"Synthesis, characterization, and in vivo diagnostic applications of hyaluronic acid immobilized gold nanoprobes.","Herein we describe a new class of multifunctional gold nanoprobes for ultra-sensitive optical detection of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and hyaluronidase (HAdase). The nanoprobes were fabricated by end-immobilizing near-infrared fluorescence (NIRF) dye labeled hyaluronic acid (HA) onto the surface of gold nanoparticles (AuNPs). The nanoprobes effectively induced nanoparticle surface energy transfer (NSET) between NIRF dyes and AuNPs. When the surface immobilized HA was cleaved by ROS and HAdase, strong fluorescence recovery signals were attained with extreme sensitivity. In live animal models of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and metastatic tumor, local arthritic inflammation and tumor sites were clearly identified upon systemic injection of the nanoprobes. These results suggest that the gold nanoprobes can be exploited not only as in vitro molecular and cellular imaging sensors for ROS and HAdase, but also as in vivo optical imaging agents for detection of local HA degrading diseases such as RA and tumor.",Biomaterials,2008,downloaded,10.1016/j.biomaterials.2008.08.038
